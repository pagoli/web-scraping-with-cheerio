    "painting_info": "\nSalvator Mundi (Latin for ''Savior of the World'') is a painting attributed in whole or in part to the Italian High Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci, dated to c. 1499–1510. Long thought to be a copy of a lost original veiled with overpainting, it was rediscovered, restored, and included in a major exhibition of Leonardo's work at the National Gallery, London, in 2011–2012. Christie's claimed just after selling the work that most leading scholars consider it to be an original work by Leonardo, but this attribution has been disputed by other leading specialists, some of whom propose that he only contributed certain elements; and others who believe that the extensive damage prevents a definitive attribution.\nThe painting depicts Christ in an anachronistic blue Renaissance dress, making the sign of the cross with his right hand, while holding a transparent, non-refracting crystal orb in his left, signaling his role as Salvator Mundi and representing the 'celestial sphere' of the heavens. Approximately thirty copies and variations of the work by pupils and followers of Leonardo have been identified. Two preparatory chalk and ink drawings of the drapery by Leonardo are held in the British Royal Collection.\nThe painting was sold at auction for US$450.3 million on 15 November 2017 by Christie's in New York to Prince Badr bin Abdullah Al Saud, setting a new record for the most expensive painting ever sold at public auction. Prince Badr allegedly made the purchase on behalf of Abu Dhabi's Department of Culture and Tourism, but it has since been posited that he may have been a stand-in bidder for his close ally, the Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. This follows reports in late 2017 that the painting would be put on display at the Louvre Abu Dhabi and the unexplained cancellation of its scheduled unveiling in September 2018. The current location of the painting has been reported as unknown, but a report in June 2019 stated that it was being stored on bin Salman's yacht, pending the completion of a cultural center in Al-'Ula, and a later report indicated it may be in storage in Switzerland.\nArt historians have suggested several possibilities for when the work was executed and who the patron may have been. Christie's stated that it was probably commissioned around 1500, shortly after King Louis XII of France conquered the Duchy of Milan and took control of Genoa in the Second Italian War; Leonardo himself moved from Milan to Florence in 1500. The art historian Luke Syson agrees, dating the painting to c. 1499, though Martin Kemp and Frank Zöllner date the work to c. 1504–1510 and c. 1507 or later respectively. Based on their similarity in style and materials to the studies for The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne, Carlo Pedretti dates the drapery studies in the Royal Collection, and thus the painting, to 1510–1515.\nBecause of the specificity of the subject, Leonardo's Salvator Mundi was probably commissioned by a specific patron rather than produced on speculation. Isabella d'Este, Duchess of Milan, is cited as a possible patron as in 1504 she had wished to commission from Leonardo a \"youthful Christ of around twelve years, of that age that he had when he disputed in the Temple\", though Salvator Mundi shows a more mature Christ. Carlo Pedretti notes that Isabella d'Este was a guest of Leonardo's patron Giulianio de'Medici in 1514 and so may have convinced the artist to complete the commission at that time. Martin Kemp does not draw conclusions, but likewise discusses the possibility of Isabella d'Este as patron — though he also considers the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus, Charles VIII of France and others. Joanne Snow-Smith argued that Leonardo painted the Salvator Mundi for Louis XII of France and his consort, Anne of Brittany. This view was echoed by the Royal Collection in their 2018 exhibition Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing and is supported by the early French provenance of many of the copies of the Salvator Mundi.\nThe painting would have been used in the context of personal devotion, as were other panels of this size and subject in the sixteenth century. Indeed, Snow-Smith emphasizes in her writings the devotional relationship that Louis XII and Anne of Brittany had with the Salvator Mundi as a subject and Frank Zöllner discussed the painting's relationship to French illuminated manuscripts in the practice of early sixteenth-century personal devotion and prayer. \nIt is possible that the painting was recorded in a 1525 inventory of Salaì's estate as \"Christo in mondo de uno Dio padre\", though it is unclear to which Salvator Mundi this might refer. The provenance of the painting breaks after 1530.\nThe Salvator Mundi as an image type predates Leonardo. Thus, Martin Kemp argues that on one hand Leonardo was constrained in his composition by the expected iconography of the Salvator Mundi, but on the other hand, he was able to use the image as a vehicle for spiritual communication between the spectator and the likeness of Christ. The composition has its sources in Byzantine art, the imagery of which further developed in northern Europe before finding its place in the Italian states. Snow-Smith relates the development of the Salvator Mundi to Byzantine iconography and narratives of images of Christ \"not made by human hands\". Such acheiropoeta would include the Mandylion of Edessa, the Keramidion, and the Veil of Veronica. Although the Salvator Mundi has its origins in the acheiropoeta, Snow-Smith discusses, the Salvator Mundi emerged in the fifteenth century through such intermediate subjects as Christ as Pantocrator, Christ in Majesty, and The Last Judgement, which like the acheiropoeta betray their Byzantine origins through their frontal depictions of Christ. The frontality of Christ is shared by other images of Christ and God the Father in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, including in 'portrait' images of Christ, which feature only Christ at half-length and without the orb or blessing gesture, as well as in images of 'Christ Blessing' which does not show Christ holding an orb. Images of Christ holding a sphere became widely popular following Charlemagne's adoption of the globus cruciger and the scepter. The earliest true Salvator Mundi images are found in northern Europe. Indeed, the iconography of the Salvator Mundi came to fruition in paintings such as Robert Campin's Blessing Christ and Praying Virgin and in the central panel of Rogier van der Weyden's Braque Triptych, before such images became common in Italy later in the fifteenth century. Works by such artists as Antonello da Messina and his Christ Blessing betray the influence of Northern artists in the Italian states.\nThe earliest Italian example of a Salvator Mundi is likely to be Simone Martini's Salvator Mundi Surrounded by Angels at the Palais des Papes, Avignon. This image shows Christ at full length rather than the bust-length portrayals of later paintings of the Salvator Mundi. The image of Salvator Mundi later became well known in Italy, and especially Venice, through the archetype from Giovanni Bellini, now known only through copies. This includes Andrea Previtali's painting at the National Gallery, London. Another fifteenth-century example can be seen in the Palazzo Ducale in Urbino in the very damaged painting by Melozzo da Forlì. It has been suggested that Leonardo based his composition on this specific example.\nThere are at least thirty copies and variations of the painting executed by Leonardo's pupils and followers, as counted by Robert Simon. The large number of these paintings is an important part of the pedigree of Leonardo's painting and emphasizes that there must have been an original by Leonardo from which they were copied. The most significant and widely discussed among these is the painting formerly in the de Ganay collection, as this one shares most closely the same composition and demonstrates the highest technical skill of Leonardo's pupils. This is so much the case that Joanne Snow-Smith proposed it to be the original painting in 1978. The many other copies found in Naples, Detroit, Warsaw, Zürich and other public and private collections contain various attributions to members of Leonardo's pupils and followers. Some versions differ significantly from the original. Two examples can be found in the form of a 'portrait' such as in Salaí's 1511 painting, as well as in a painting sold at Sotheby's on 5 December 2018, both of which use Leonardo's Salvator Mundi as their model but which do not employ the iconography of the blessing hand or globe. Other artists use the same model but for other subjects, as is the case with Leonardo's Spanish follower Fernando Yáñez de la Almedina and the Eucharistic Christ now at the Museo del Prado.\nLeonardo's studio and his followers likewise produced at least four Salvator Mundi panels depicting a youthful Christ who is less frontal in his pose and who holds a terrestrial globe. These are largely from Leonardo's Milanese following rather than from members of his studio, though the variant in Rome can reasonably be attributed to his pupil Marco d'Oggiono.\nThis painting seems to have been at James Hamilton's Chelsea Manor in London from 1638 to 1641. After participating in the English Civil War, Hamilton was executed on 9 March 1649 and some of his possessions were taken to the Netherlands to be sold. The Bohemian artist Wenceslaus Hollar could have made his engraved copy, dated 1650, in Antwerp at that time. It was also recorded in Henrietta Maria's possession in 1649, the same year her husband Charles I was executed, on 30 January. The painting was included in an inventory of the Royal Collection, valued at £30, and Charles's possessions were put up for sale under the English Commonwealth. The painting was sold to a creditor in 1651, returned to Charles II after the English Restoration in 1660, and included in an inventory of Charles's possessions at the Palace of Whitehall in 1666. It was inherited by James II, and may have remained with him until it passed to his mistress Catherine Sedley, whose illegitimate daughter with James became the third wife of John Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham. The duke's illegitimate son, Sir Charles Herbert Sheffield, auctioned the painting in 1763 along with other artworks from Buckingham House when the building was sold to George III.\nThe painting was probably placed in a gilded frame in the nineteenth century, in which it remained until 2005. It is probably the painting bought by the British collector Francis Cook in 1900 from J.C. Robinson for his collection at Doughty House in Richmond, London. The painting had been damaged by previous restoration attempts and was attributed to Bernardino Luini, a follower of Leonardo. Sir Francis Cook, 4th Baronet, Cook's great-grandson, sold it at auction in 1958 for £45 as a work by Leonardo's pupil Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio, to whom the painting remained attributed until 2011.\nThe original painting by Leonardo was thought to have been destroyed or lost around 1603. In 1978, Joanne Snow-Smith argued that the copy in the collection of the Marquis Jean-Louis de Ganay in Paris was the lost original, based on, among other things, its similarity to Leonardo's Saint John the Baptist. While Snow-Smith was thorough in her research in regard to the provenance of the painting and its relationship to Hollar, few art historians were convinced of her attribution.\nIn 2005, a Salvator Mundi was presented at an auction at the St. Charles Gallery auction house in New Orleans, consigned from the estate of the Baton Rouge businessman Basil Clovis Hendry Sr. It had been heavily overpainted, to the point where the painting resembled a copy, and was, before restoration, described as \"a wreck, dark and gloomy\". It was acquired by a consortium of art dealers that included Alexander Parish and Robert Simon, a specialist in Old Masters. The consortium paid $1,175 for the painting.\nThe consortium believed there was a possibility that this seemingly low-quality work might be Leonardo's long-missing original; as a consequence, they commissioned Dianne Dwyer Modestini at New York University to oversee the restoration. When Modestini began removing the overpainting with acetone at the beginning of the restoration process, she discovered that at some point a stepped area of unevenness near Christ's face had been shaved down with a sharp object, and also levelled with a mixture of gesso, paint, and glue. Using infrared photographs Simon had taken of the painting, Modestini discovered a pentimento (a trace of an earlier composition), which had the blessing hand's thumb in a straight, rather than curved, position. The discovery that Christ had two thumbs on his right hand was crucial. This pentimento showed that the original artist had reconsidered the position of the figure; such a second thought is considered evidence of an original, rather than a copy, as a painting copied from the finished original would not have such an alteration partway through the painting process.\nModestini proceeded to have the panel specialist Monica Griesbach chisel off a woodworm-infested marouflaged panel, which had caused the painting to break into seven pieces. Griesbach reassembled the painting with adhesive and wood slivers. In late 2006, Modestini began her restoration effort. The art historian Martin Kemp was critical of the result: \"Both thumbs\" of the painting's raw state \"are rather better than the one painted by Dianne\". Other experts have also been critical of the extensive level of restoration undertaken by Modestini, and that it had impeded any attribution of the work (and some calling it a \"contemporary work\" or a \"masterpiece by Modestini\").  From November 2011 through February 2012, the painting was exhibited at the National Gallery, London, as an autograph work by Leonardo, after authentication by that gallery. The painting was stored at the Dallas Museum of Art for the remainder of 2012 while museum leadership attempted and failed to raise the necessary funds to purchase the painting.\nIn May 2013, the Swiss dealer Yves Bouvier purchased the painting for just over US$75 million in a private sale brokered by Sotheby's, New York. The painting was then sold to the Russian collector Dmitry Rybolovlev for US$127.5 million. The price that Rybolovlev paid was therefore significantly higher, well beyond the 2 percent commission Bouvier was supposed to receive, according to Rybolovlev himself. Consequently, this sale—along with several other sales Bouvier made to Rybolovlev—created a legal dispute between Rybolovlev and Bouvier, as well as between the original dealers of the painting and Sotheby's. In 2016, the dealers sued Sotheby's for the difference of the sale, arguing that they were shortchanged. The auction house has denied knowing that Rybolovlev was the intended buyer, and sought to dismiss the lawsuit. In 2018, Rybolovlev also sued Sotheby's for $380 million, alleging that the auction house knowingly participated in a defrauding scheme by Bouvier, in which the painting played a part. Rybolovlev's lawyers believe email exchanges between Bouvier and Sotheby's confirmed this.\nThe painting was exhibited in Hong Kong, London, San Francisco, and New York in 2017, and then sold at auction at Christie's in New York on 15 November 2017 for $450,312,500, a new record price for an artwork (the hammer price was $400 million, plus $50.3 million in fees). The purchaser was identified as the Saudi Arabian prince Badr bin Abdullah. In December 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that Prince Badr was an intermediary for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. However, Christie's confirmed that Prince Badr acted on behalf of Abu Dhabi's Department of Culture and Tourism for display at the Louvre Abu Dhabi. In September 2018, the exhibition was indefinitely postponed, and a news report of January 2019 noted that \"no one knows where it is, and there are grave concerns for its physical safety\". Georgina Adam, editor at large of The Art Newspaper, dismissed these reports, stating that \"We believe it's in storage in Geneva.\" In June 2019, the painting was reported to be on a luxury yacht belonging to bin Salman, sailing on the Red Sea.\nThe painting again failed to appear in the Louvre's Paris exhibition of Leonardo's works, held from 24 October 2019 to 24 February 2020. The exhibition displayed 11 paintings by Leonardo, of the fewer than 20 known to survive, but not the Salvator Mundi. However, the 46-page booklet that accompanied the exhibition – briefly available in the museum bookshop – detailed the Louvre's scientific examinations and concluded that \"the results of the historical and scientific study ... allow us to confirm the attribution of the work to Leonardo da Vinci\". In June 2021, The Observer newspaper quoted skeptical comments about the sale from Robert King Wittman, a former FBI art crime specialist: \"Why anyone would pay that kind of money for a piece that had questions about it is very strange. That particular painting is not worth what was paid for it. So there is a suspicious aspect to it. And the provenance is very murky.\"\nAbout a year into her restoration effort, Dianne Dwyer Modestini noted that colour transitions in the subject's lips were \"perfect\" and that \"no other artist could have done that\". Upon studying the Mona Lisa for comparison, she concluded that \"The artist who painted her was the same hand that had painted the Salvator Mundi\". Since then, she has disseminated high-resolution images and technical information online for the scholarly community and public.\nIn 2006 Nicholas Penny, director of the National Gallery, wrote that he and some of his colleagues considered the work an autograph Leonardo, but that \"some of us consider that there may be  which are by the workshop\". Penny conducted a side-by-side study of the Salvator Mundi and the Virgin of the Rocks in 2008. Martin Kemp later said of the meeting, \"I left the studio thinking Leonardo must be heavily involved\", and that \"No one in the assembly was openly expressing doubt that Leonardo was responsible for the painting.\" In a 2011 consensus decision facilitated by Penny, the attribution to Leonardo was agreed upon unequivocally. By July 2011, separate press release documents were issued by the owners' publicity representative and the National Gallery, officially announcing the \"new discovery\".\nOnce it was cleaned and restored, the painting was compared with, and found superior to, twenty other versions of the composition. It was on display in the National Gallery's exhibition Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan from November 2011 to February 2012. Several features in the painting have led to the positive attribution: a number of pentimenti are evident, most notably the position of the right thumb. The sfumato effect of the face—evidently achieved in part by manipulating the paint using the heel of the hand—is typical of many works by Leonardo. The way the ringlets of hair and the knotwork across the stole have been handled is also seen as indicative of Leonardo's style. Furthermore, the pigments and the walnut panel upon which the work was executed are consistent with other Leonardo paintings. Additionally, the hands in the painting are very detailed, something for which Leonardo is known: he would dissect the limbs of the deceased in order to study them and render body parts in an extremely lifelike manner.\nOne of the world's leading Leonardo experts, Martin Kemp, who helped authenticate the work, said that he knew immediately upon first viewing the restored painting that it was the work of Leonardo: \"It had that kind of presence that Leonardos have ... that uncanny strangeness that the later Leonardo paintings manifest.\" Of the better-preserved parts, such as the hair, Kemp notes: \"It's got that kind of uncanny vortex, as if the hair is a living, moving substance, or like water, which is what Leonardo said hair was like\". Kemp also states:\nHowever skilled Leonardo's followers and imitators might have been, none of them reached out into such realms of \"philosophical and subtle speculation\". We cannot reasonably doubt that here, we are in the presence of the painter from Vinci.In his biography of Leonardo, Walter Isaacson notes that the celestial sphere that Christ is holding does not correspond to the way such an orb would realistically look. It also shows no reflection. Isaacson writes that\nIn one respect, it is rendered with beautiful scientific precision, but Leonardo failed to paint the distortion that would occur when looking through a solid clear orb at objects that are not touching the orb. Solid glass or crystal, whether shaped like an orb or a lens, produces magnified, inverted, and reversed images. Instead, Leonardo painted the orb as if it were a hollow glass bubble that does not refract or distort the light passing through it.Isaacson believes that this was \"a conscious decision on Leonardo's part\", and speculates that either Leonardo felt a more accurate portrayal would be distracting, or that \"he was subtly trying to impart a miraculous quality to Christ and his orb.\" Kemp agrees that \"To show the full effects of the sphere on the drapery behind would have been grotesque in a functioning devotional image\". Kemp further states that the doubled outline of the heel of the hand holding the sphere—which the restorer described as a pentimento—is an accurate rendering of the double refraction produced by a transparent calcite (or rock crystal) sphere. However, this continues outside the globe itself. Kemp further notes that the orb \"sparkles with a series of internal inclusions (or pockets of air)\"—evidence in support of its being solid. More recently, the globe has been also interpreted as a magnifying instrument consisting of a vitreous globe filled with water (which in nature would also distort the background). André J. Noest suggests that the three painted specks represent celestial bodies.\nOther versions or copies of the Salvator Mundi often depict a brass, solid spherical orb, terrestrial globe, or globus cruciger; occasionally, they appear to be made of translucent glass, or show landscapes within them. The orb in Leonardo's painting, Kemp says, has \"an amazing series of glistening little apertures—they're like bubbles, but they're not round—painted very delicately, with just a touch of impasto, a touch of dark, and these little sort of glistening things, particularly around the part where you get the back reflections\". These are the characteristic features of rock crystal, on which Leonardo was an avid expert. He had been asked to evaluate vases that Isabella d'Este had thought of purchasing, and greatly admired the properties of the mineral.\nIconographically, the crystal sphere relates to the heavens. In Ptolemaic cosmology, the stars were embedded in a fixed celestial crystalline sphere (composed of aether), with the spherical Earth at the center of the universe. \"So what you've got in the Salvator Mundi\", Kemp states, \"is really 'a savior of the cosmos', and this is a very Leonardesque transformation.\"\nAnother aspect of Leonardo's painting Kemp studied was depth of field, or shallow focus. Christ's blessing hand appears to be in sharp focus, whereas his face—though altered or damaged to some extent—is in soft focus. In his manuscript of 1508–1509 known as Paris Manuscript D, Leonardo explored theories of vision, optics of the eye, and theories relating to shadow, light, and colour. In the Salvator Mundi, he deliberately placed an emphasis on parts of the picture over others. Elements in the foreground are seen in focus, while elements further from the picture plane, such as the subject's face, are barely in focus. Paris Manuscript D shows that Leonardo was investigating this particular phenomenon around the turn of the century. Combined, the intellectual aspects, optical aspects, and the use of semi-precious minerals are distinctive features of Leonardo's oeuvre.\n\"There is extraordinary consensus it is by Leonardo,\" said the former co-chairman of old master paintings at Christie's, Nicholas Hall: \"This is the most important old master painting to have been sold at auction in my lifetime.\" Christie's lists the ways scholars confirmed the attribution to Leonardo da Vinci:\nThe reasons for the unusually uniform scholarly consensus that the painting is an autograph work by Leonardo are several, including the previously mentioned relationship of the painting to the two autograph preparatory drawings in Windsor Castle; its correspondence to the composition of the 'Salvator Mundi' documented in Wenceslaus Hollar's etching of 1650; and its manifest superiority to the more than 20 known painted versions of the composition.Furthermore, the extraordinary quality of the picture, especially evident in its best-preserved areas, and its close adherence in style to Leonardo's known paintings from circa 1500, solidifies this consensus.According to Robert Simon, \"Leonardo painted the Salvator Mundi with walnut oil rather than linseed oil, as all the other artists in that period did ... In fact, he wrote about using walnut oil, as it was a new advanced technique.\" Simon also states that ultraviolet imaging reveals that the darker areas of the painting are mostly owing to the restoration; the rest is original paint.\nThe art critic Ben Lewis, who disputes a full attribution to Leonardo, admits that his authorship of the work is possible, owing to the originality of the face, which has \"something modern about it\". Kemp says:\nI don't rule out the possibility of studio participation ... But I cannot define any areas that I would say are studio work.An examination of the painting had been conducted by the Louvre's laboratory C2RMF in June 2018. A publication was prepared by the Louvre and printed in December 2019 in case the Louvre had the chance to present the painting in its exhibition, and was temporarily available in the Louvre bookshop. It contains essays by Vincent Delieuvin, the chief curator of paintings at the Louvre, and Myriam Eveno and Elisabeth Ravaud from the Louvre's laboratory C2RMF. In his preface, the museum's director Jean-Luc Martinez states that \"The results of the historical and scientific study presented in this publication allow us to confirm the attribution of the work to Leonardo da Vinci, an appealing hypothesis which was initially presented in 2010 and which has sometimes been disputed\". Delieuvin differentiated the picture from other studio versions – including the Ganay version that appeared in the Louvre's Leonardo exhibition – by the presence of subtle underpainting, numerous pentimenti, and pictorial quality. He concludes:All these factors invite us to privilege the idea of a work that is entirely autograph, sadly damaged by the poor conservation of the work and by previous restorations which were too brutal.In the discussion of the scientific evidence, Ravaud and Eveno write: The examination of the Salvator Mundi seems to us to demonstrate that the painting was indeed executed by Leonardo. It is essential in this context to distinguish the original parts from those that have been changed or repainted and this is indeed what was carried out during this study notably by using X-ray fluorescence. Examination under a microscope revealed very skilful execution, notably in the skin colouring and in the curls of the hair, and great refinement notably in the depiction of the relief of the embroidery .\nRadiography showed up the same very faint outlines as in the St. Anne, Mona Lisa and St. John the Baptist, characteristic of Leonardo's work after 1500. The number of changes made during the creation of the work also plead in favour of an autograph work. The first version of the central 'plastron' with a pointed form, is immediately comparable to the central part of the tunic in the Windsor drawing and to our knowledge is not seen anywhere else.\n\nIn addition, the movement of the thumb was also noted in the St. John by Leonardo. After intensive studies of the other Leonardo works in the Louvre's collection it seems to us that a number of the techniques observed in the Salvator Mundi are typical of Leonardo—the originality of the preparation, the use of ground glass and the remarkable use of vermillion in the hair and shadows. These latest elements all plead in favour of a late work by Leonardo, after St. John the Baptist, and dating from the second Milan period.Some respected experts on Renaissance art question the full attribution of the painting to Leonardo. Jacques Franck, a Paris-based art historian and Leonardo specialist who has studied the Mona Lisa out of the frame multiple times, stated: \"The composition doesn't come from Leonardo, he preferred twisted movement. It's a good studio work with a little Leonardo at best, and it's very damaged. It's been called 'the male Mona Lisa', but it doesn't look like it at all.\"\nMichael Daley, the director of ArtWatch UK, doubts the Salvator Mundi's authenticity and theorizes that it may be the prototype of a subject painted by Leonardo: \"This quest for an autograph prototype Leonardo painting might seem moot or vain: not only do the two drapery studies comprise the only accepted Leonardo material that might be associated with the group, but within the Leonardo literature there is no documentary record of the artist ever having been involved in such a painting project.\"\nCarmen Bambach, a specialist in Italian Renaissance art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, questioned full attribution to Leonardo: \"having studied and followed the picture during its conservation treatment, and seeing it in the context in the National Gallery exhibition, much of the original painting surface may be by Boltraffio, but with passages done by Leonardo himself, namely Christ's proper right blessing hand, portions of the sleeve, his left hand and the crystal orb he holds.\" In 2019, Bambach criticised Christie's for its claim that she was one of the experts who had attributed the painting to Leonardo. In her 2019 book Leonardo da Vinci Rediscovered, she is even more specific, attributing most of the work to Boltraffio, \"with only 'small retouchings' by the master himself\".\nMatthew Landrus, an art historian at the University of Oxford, agreed with the concept of parts of the painting being executed by Leonardo (\"between 5 and 20%\"), but attributes the painting to Leonardo's studio assistant Bernardino Luini, noting Luini's ability in painting gold tracery.\nFrank Zöllner, the author of the catalogue raisonné Leonardo da Vinci. The Complete Paintings and Drawings. writes:\nThis attribution is controversial primarily on two grounds. Firstly, the badly damaged painting had to undergo very extensive restoration, which makes its original quality extremely difficult to assess. Secondly, the Salvator Mundi in its present state exhibits a strongly developed sfumato technique that corresponds more closely to the manner of a talented Leonardo pupil active in the 1520s than to the style of the master himself. The way in which the painting was placed on the market also gave rise to concern.Zöllner also explains that the quality of Salvator Mundi surpasses other known versions; however,\n also exhibits a number of weaknesses. The flesh tones of the blessing hand, for example, appear pallid and waxen as in a number of workshop paintings. Christ's ringlets also seem to me too schematic in their execution, the larger drapery folds too undifferentiated, especially on the right-hand side ... It will probably only be possible to arrive at a more informed verdict on this question after the results of the painting's technical analyses have been published in full.In a subsequent interview for the 2021 documentary The Lost Leonardo, Zöllner said: \"You have the old parts of the painting which are original—these are by pupils—and the new parts of the painting, which look like Leonardo, but they are by the restorer. In some part, it's a masterpiece by Dianne Modestini\".\nIn Paris, the Louvre's request for the Salvator Mundi to be exhibited in its Leonardo da Vinci exhibition of 2019–2020 was reportedly met without response. The New York Times reported in April 2021 that the non-appearance was because the French were unwilling to meet Saudi demands that the painting be hung alongside the Mona Lisa. The Louvre's inability to comment on the matter in the interim, however, led to speculation that its absence was due to doubts over its full attribution to the artist.\nIn November 2021, scholars at the Museo del Prado included the painting under \"attributed works, workshop of authorized and supervised by Leonardo\" in the catalogue for Leonardo and the Copy of the Mona Lisa. The Prado curator Ana Gonzales Monzo wrote in the catalog that the Ganay-collection copy of the Salvador Mundi was likely the closest to Leonardo's original design, and that it was likely done by the same artist that painted the Prado copy of the Mona Lisa. The curator of the Louvre's 2019–20 Leonardo exhibition, Vincent Delieuvin, wrote in the Prado catalog that the painting had \"details of surprisingly poor quality\", and that \"It is to be hoped that a future permanent display of the work will allow it to be reanalyzed with greater objectivity\".\nThe British art historian Charles Hope dismissed the attribution to Leonardo entirely in a January 2020 analysis of the painting's quality and provenance. He doubted that Leonardo would have painted a work where the eyes were not level and the drapery undistorted by a crystal orb. He added, \"The picture itself is a ruin, with the face much restored to make it reminiscent of the Mona Lisa.\" Hope condemned the National Gallery's involvement in Simon's \"astute\" marketing campaign.\nIn August 2020, Jacques Franck, who had previously called the portrait \"a good studio work with a little Leonardo at best,\" cited its \"childishly conceived left hand\", as well as the \"oddly long and thin nose, the simplified mouth  the over shadowy neck\" as evidence that Leonardo did not paint it. More precisely, Franck now attributes the painting to Salaì jointly with Boltraffio: in effect, the work's infrared reflectogram betrays a very singular sketching-out technique, never seen in any of Leonardo's original paintings, yet encountered in Salaì's Head of Christ of 1511 in the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, a composition close to the Saudi Salvator Mundi and signed by the artist. This claim is also supported by the fact that a stricto sensu Salvator Mundi painting is recorded in Salai's posthumous inventory of the estate established in Milan on 25 April 1525.\nIn November 2020, a newly discovered drawing of Christ surfaced, possibly by Leonardo and with notable differences from the painting. According to the Leonardo scholar Annalisa Di Maria, \" is the true face of Salvator Mundi.  recalls everything in the drawings of Leonardo,\" pointing to the similar three-quarters view used in his presumed self-portrait. She continued, \" could never have portrayed such a frontal and motionless character.\" Kemp indicated that before he could review the drawing, he \"would need to see if it is drawn left-handed.\"\n\nThe rediscovered painting by Leonardo generated considerable interest within the media and general public amid its pre-auction viewings in Hong Kong, London, San Francisco and New York, as well as after the sale. More than 27,000 people saw the work in person before the auction: the highest number of pre-sale viewers for an individual work of art, according to Christie's. The sale was the first time Christie's had used an outside agency to advertise an artwork. Approximately 4,500 people stood in line to preview the work in New York the weekend prior to the sale. The sensationalism of the painting following the sale led to it being a common subject in popular culture and discourse online. As Brian Boucher described, \"the internet went a little bonkers\" in response to the sale, leading to sarcastic and humorous comments and memes on Twitter, Instagram and other social media sites. Similarly, Stephanie Eckardt noted how \"the ongoing saga of Salvator Mundi indisputably\" belongs in \"the meme canon.\" In an article in the Art Market Monitor, Marion Maneker compared the sensationalism around Salvator Mundi to the media coverage surrounding the theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in 1911. Just as the international media sensationalism lifted the painting to a high international status, she argued, so too did Christie's marketing campaign and media sensationalism lead to its high sales price. Alexandra Kim of the Harvard Crimson similarly described the reason for the painting's newfound fame:Why are we still so adamantly curious ? The New York Times, The Guardian, and more have covered this painting and its aftermath. It now seems that the drama surrounding this infamous painting has created a whole new work of art larger than the Salvator Mundi itself. The attention has grossly inflated its value: the more we discuss the work, the more curious we are until it becomes a shining ball of artistic enlightenment.The narratives surrounding the painting have piqued the interest of filmmakers and playwrights. In July 2020, the company Caiola Productions announced that it was working on the production of a Broadway musical based on the history of Leonardo's Salvator Mundi. In April 2021, Antoine Vitkine directed a feature-length documentary entitled The Savior for Sale, focusing on the painting and its exclusion from the 2019–2020 Leonardo exhibition at the Louvre. Shortly afterward, in June 2021, Andreas Koefoed's documentary The Lost Leonardo premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, exploring how the painting became the most expensive ever sold and the trail of buyers involved, the debate around its attribution and provenance, and its failure to appear at the 2019–2020 Louvre exhibition.\nSchool of Leonardo da Vinci, Salvator Mundi (c. 1503), private collection (formerly Marquis Jean-Louis de Ganay Collection).\nFollower of Leonardo da Vinci, Salvator Mundi (1508–1513), Museum of San Domenico Maggiore, Naples.\nFollower of Leonardo da Vinci, Salvator Mundi (Cristo Redentore benedicente; early 16th century), Worsey Collection.\nGiampietrino, Salvator Mundi (16th century), Detroit Institute of Arts.\nCesare da Sesto, Salvator Mundi (1516–1517), Wilanów Palace, Warsaw\nFollower of Leonardo da Vinci, Salvator Mundi (16th century), Sammlung Stark, Zürich.\nLombard follower of Leonardo da Vinci (possibly Marco d'Oggiono), Salvator Mundi (16th century), private collection, formerly the Art Gallery of Ontario.\nSalaì, Head of Christ the Redeemer (1511), Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, Milan.\nMilanese follower of Leonardo da Vinci, Bust of Christ (c. 1511–1513) private collection (Sotheby's Old Masters Evening Sale 5 December 2018).\nFernando Yáñez de la Almedina, The Eucharistic Christ (c. 1525), Museo del Prado, Madrid.\nMarco d'Oggiono, Salvator Mundi (c. 1500), Galleria Borghese, Rome.\nSchool of Leonardo da Vinci, Le Sauveur du monde (c. 1505), Museum of Fine Arts of Nancy.\nGiampietrino, Salvator Mundi, (early 16th century), Pushkin Museum, Moscow.\nFollower of Leonardo da Vinci, Cristo giovanetto come Salvator Mundi, Museo Ideale Leonardo da Vinci.\nUnknown French miniaturist, Pentecost from the Ingeborg Psalter (c. 1195), Musée Condé, Chantilly.

    "painting_info": "Interchange, also known as Interchanged, is an abstract expressionist oil painting on canvas by Dutch-American painter Willem de Kooning (1904–1997). Like Jackson Pollock, de Kooning was one of the early artists of the abstract expressionism movement, the first American modern art movement. The painting measures 200.7 by 175.3 centimetres (79.0 by 69.0 in) and was completed in 1955. It marked the transition of the subjects of de Kooning's paintings from women to abstract urban landscapes. It reflects a transition in de Kooning's painting technique due the influence of artist Franz Kline, who inspired de Kooning to paint with quickly made gestural marks as opposed to violent brush strokes. The painting features a fleshy pink mass at its center, representing a seated woman.\nOriginally sold by the artist in 1955 for $4,000, it was sold by the David Geffen Foundation to Kenneth C. Griffin for $300 million in September 2015, then ranking it first on the list of most expensive paintings.\nIt has been on loan at the Art Institute of Chicago. It is now ranked second on the list of most expensive paintings, only surpassed by Leonardo da Vinci’s Salvator Mundi, which sold for $450.3 million in November 2017.\nInterchange was completed in 1955. de Kooning had concentrated much of the early part of the 1950s reworking abstract figure study works of the female figure which he started in 1948. These were associated with his solo exhibition in 1953 which was called Paintings on the Theme of the Woman which opened in New York City that year. Some of the titles for these works were associated with various states of Woman I, Woman III and Woman, as well as Two Standing Women. By 1955, de Kooning had moved away from painting the human form and continued with the abstract rendering of the architecture and communities of his surroundings in New York City. Some of de Kooning's 1955 oil paintings prominent at that time were Police Gazette, Composition, Gotham News, Saturday Night, and Easter Monday.\nDe Kooning's preferences for the selection of names for his oil paintings appeared to correspond to references to the neighborhood where he was living at that time in New York City, for example, Interchange.\nDe Kooning sold the painting in a gallery shortly after it was completed for $4,000 to architect Edgar Kaufmann Jr., whose father Edgar J. Kaufmann owned Kaufmann's department store in Pittsburgh. Kauffman's estate sold the painting, alongside other pieces of his art collection, at Sotheby's in New York in November 1989, during the Japanese asset price bubble, to Japanese art dealer Shigeki Kameyama, owner of the Mountain Tortoise Gallery in Tokyo, for $20.7 million, setting a then-record price for a living artist. The sale occurred 3 months after a judge declared de Kooning to be mentally incompetent due to Alzheimer's disease.\nThe painting was sold a few years later to David Geffen, at a loss due to the bursting of the Japanese asset price bubble and the early 1990s recession. \nIn September 2015, Geffen sold Interchange for $300 million to hedge fund manager and billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin. Griffin paid $500 million for two artworks, including $200 million for Jackson Pollock's Number 17A.\n"

    "short_description": "Painting series by Paul Cézanne",
    "painting_info": "\nThe Card Players is a series of oil paintings by the French Post-Impressionist artist Paul Cézanne. Painted during Cézanne's final period in the early 1890s, there are five paintings in the series. The versions vary in size, the number of players, and the setting in which the game takes place. Cézanne also completed numerous drawings and studies in preparation for The Card Players series.\nOne version of The Card Players was sold in 2011 to the Royal Family of Qatar for a price estimated at $250 million ($301.1 million today), signifying a new mark for highest ever price for a painting, not surpassed until November 2017.\nThe series is considered by critics to be a cornerstone of Cézanne's art during the early-to-mid 1890s period, as well as a \"prelude\" to his final years, when he painted some of his most acclaimed work.\nEach painting depicts Provençal peasants immersed in\ntheir pipes and playing cards. The subjects, all male, are displayed as studious within their card playing, eyes cast downward, intent on the game at hand. Cézanne adapted a motif from 17th-century Dutch and French genre painting which often depicted card games with rowdy, drunken gamblers in taverns, replacing them instead with stone-faced tradesmen in a more simplified setting. Whereas previous paintings of the genre had illustrated heightened moments of drama, Cézanne's portraits have been noted for their lack of drama, narrative, and conventional characterization. Other than an unused wine bottle in the two-player versions, there is an absence of drink and money, which were prominent fixtures of the 17th-century genre. A painting by one of the Le Nain brothers, hung in an Aix-en-Provence museum near the artist's home, depicts card players and is widely cited as an inspiration for the works by Cézanne.\nThe models for the paintings were local farmhands, some of whom worked on the Cézanne family estate, the Jas de Bouffan. Each scene is depicted as one of quiet, still concentration; the men look down at their cards rather than at each other, with the cards being perhaps their sole means of communication outside of work. One critic described the scenes as \"human still life\", while another speculated that the men's intense focus on their game mirrors that of the painter's absorption in his art.\nWhile there are, in total, five paintings of card players by Cézanne, the final three works were similar in composition and number of players (two), causing them to sometimes be grouped together as one version. The exact dates of the paintings are uncertain, but it is long believed Cézanne began with larger canvases and pared down in size with successive versions, though research in recent years has cast doubt on this assumption.\nThe largest version, painted between the years 1890–1892, is the most complex, with five figures on a 134.6 x 180.3 cm (53 × 71 in) canvas. It features three card players at the forefront, seated in a semi-circle at a table, with two spectators behind. On the right side of the painting, seated behind the second man and to the right of the third, is a boy, eyes cast downward, also a fixed spectator of the game. Further back, on the left side between the first and second player is a man standing, back to the wall, smoking a pipe and presumably awaiting his turn at the table. It has been speculated Cézanne added the standing man to provide depth to the painting, as well as to draw the eye to the upper portion of the canvas.\nAs with the other versions, it displays a suppressed storytelling of peasant men in loose-fitting garments with natural poses focused entirely on their game. Writer Nicholas Wadley described a \"tension in opposites\", in which elements such as shifts of color, light and shadow, shape of hat, and crease of cloth create a story of confrontation through opposition. Others have described an \"alienation\" displayed in the series to be most pronounced in this version.\nThe painting is owned and displayed by the Barnes Foundation museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nA more condensed version of this painting with four figures, long thought to be the second version of The Card Players, is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. At 65.4 x 81.9 cm (25 3/4 x 32 1/4 in), it is less than half the size of the Barnes painting. Here the composition remains virtually the same, minus the boy, with viewers' perspective slightly closer to the game, but with less space between the figures. In the previous painting, the center player as well as the boy were hatless, whereas this version has all the men hatted. Also gone are the shelf to the left with vase and lower half of a picture frame in the center of the wall, leaving only the four pipes and hanging cloth to join the smoking man behind the card players. The painting is brighter, with less focus on blue tones, than the larger version. \nX-ray and infrared studies of this version of The Card Players have shown layers of \"speculative\" graphite underdrawing, as well as heavy layers of worked oil paint, possibly suggesting it was the preliminary of Cézanne's two largest versions of the series, rather than the second version as historically believed. The underdrawing has also led analysts to believe Cézanne had difficulty transferring the men, previously painted individually in studies, onto one canvas.\nIt has been speculated that Cézanne solved this \"spatial conundrum\" in the final three versions of The Card Players, by eliminating spectators and other \"unnecessary detail\" while displaying only the \"absolute essentials\": two players immersed in their game. The scene has been described as balanced but asymmetrical, as well as naturally symmetrical with the two players being each other's \"partner in an agreed opposition\". The man on the left is smoking a pipe, wearing a tophat with a downcast brim, in darker, more formal clothing, seated upright; the man to the right is pipeless, in a shorter hat with upcast brim, lighter, more loosely fit clothing, and hunched over the table. Even cards themselves are contrasting light and dark hues. In each of the two-player paintings, a sole wine bottle rests in the mid-part of the table, said to represent a dividing line between the two participants as well as the center of the painting's \"symmetrical balance\".\nOf the three versions, perhaps the best known and most often reproduced is in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. It is also the smallest at 47.5 x 57 cm (17 3/4 x 22 1/2 in). The Orsay painting was described by art historian Meyer Schapiro as \"the most monumental and also the most refined\" of the versions, with the shapes being simpler but more varied in their relationships. It is the most sparsely painted, and generally considered the last of the Card Players series.\nThere is a shift of axis to the scene, in which the player to the left is more completely in the picture, chair included, with the appearance of being nearer to us. His partner to the right is cut off from the scene at his back, and the table is displayed at an angle to the plane. Critics have described a \"deception of restraint\" in Cézanne's use of color; graduated area of thinly applied, \"priming\" color used for solid forms and their appearance of structure is met with lilac and green used to \"liven\" the canvas, as well as the bright, deep color used on the lower half for the tablecloth. This version of the series was also part of a high-profile theft of eight Cézanne paintings from a traveling show at Aix in August 1961. The most valuable of the stolen works, The Card Players, was released as a four-color postage stamp by the French government in recognition of the loss. All of the paintings were recovered after a ransom was paid several months later.\nThe other two-player paintings are in the Courtauld Institute of Art in London and in a private collection. In February 2012, Vanity Fair reported that the royal family of Qatar had, during 2011, purchased their version of the painting for a record price variously estimated at between $250 million and $320 million from the private collection of Greek shipping magnate George Embiricos.\nThe Card Players 1894–95, Oil on canvas, 47.5 × 57 cm, Musée d'Orsay, Paris\nThe Card Players 1892–1895, Oil on canvas, 60 x 73 cm, Courtauld Institute of Art, London\nThe Card Players 1892–93, Oil on canvas, 97 × 130 cm, Private collection\nCézanne created a substantial number of studies and preparatory drawings for The Card Players series. While it had long been believed he began the series with the largest paintings and subsequently worked smaller, 21st-century x-rays of the paintings as well as further analysis of preparatory sketches and studies has led some scholars to believe Cézanne used both the studies and the smaller versions of The Card Players to prepare for the larger canvases.\nOver a dozen initial sketches and painted studies of local farmworkers were made by Cézanne in preparation for the final paintings. It has been speculated his models sat for the studies rather than the finished works themselves, and the painter possibly sketched preliminary work in an Aix cafe.\nSome of the studies have been well regarded as stand-alone works of their own volition, particularly the accompaniment piece Man with a Pipe, displayed alongside The Card Players at the Courtauld Gallery in London. The former, along with two similar paintings of smokers undertaken in the same period, are considered by many to be some of Cézanne's most masterful portraits.\nMan with the Pipe c. 1890, Oil on canvas, 90 × 72 cm, Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg\nMan with a Pipe c. 1892, Oil on canvas, 73 x 60 cm, Courtauld Institute of Art, London\nMan Smoking a Pipe 1890–1892, Oil on canvas, 72 x 91 cm, Pushkin Museum, Moscow\nMan with a Pipe (Study for The Card Players) 1890–1892, Oil on canvas, 39 x 30.2 cm, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, Missouri\nStudy for The Card Players 1890–1892, Oil on canvas, 32 x 35 cm, Worcester Art Museum, Worcester, Massachusetts\nStudy for Card Players 1890–1892, Graphite and watercolor on paper, Rhode Island School of Design Museum, Providence, Rhode Island\nIn 2010–11, a joint exhibition was curated by the Courtauld Gallery in London and Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to display The Card Players paintings, early studies and sketches of the series, and accompanying works. The exhibition ran in London from 21 October 2010 to 16 January 2011 and in New York from 9 February 2011 to 8 May 2011.\nIt was described as the first exhibition devoted to the series as well as the largest collection of Cézanne's Card Players paintings to ever be exhibited together. The exhibition included the paintings owned by the Courtauld, Metropolitan, and Musée d'Orsay. The versions at the Barnes Foundation and in a private collection were displayed as prints, due to the Barnes' policy of not lending and the private collector declining to release the work. The mini-series of men smoking pipes sometimes referred to as The Smokers was also included with over a dozen other studies and sketches, however a legal dispute also prevented the Hermitage Museum's version of Man with a Pipe from traveling to New York.\n"

    "painting_info": "\nWhen Will You Marry? (French: Quand te maries-tu ?, Tahitian: Nafea faa ipoipo?) is an oil painting from 1892 by the French Post-Impressionist artist Paul Gauguin. On loan to the Kunstmuseum in Basel, Switzerland for nearly a half-century, it was sold privately by the family of Rudolf Staechelin to Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad Al-Thani, in February 2015 for close to US$210 million (£155 million), one of the highest prices ever paid for a work of art. The painting was on exhibition at the Fondation Beyeler, Riehen, until 28 June 2015.\nGauguin travelled to Tahiti for the first time in 1891. His hope was to find \"an edenic paradise where he could create pure, 'primitive' art\", rather than the primitivist faux works being turned out by painters in France. Upon arrival, he found that Tahiti was not as he imagined it: it had been colonised in the 18th century, and at least two-thirds of the indigenous people of the island had been killed by diseases brought by Europeans. \"Primitive\" culture had been wiped out. Despite this, he painted many pictures of native women: nude, dressed in traditional Tahitian clothes, and dressed in Western-style dresses, as is the rear figure in When Will You Marry?.\nThe front and middle ground are built up in areas of green, yellow and blue. A traditionally dressed young woman has settled on the threshold between the front and middle ground. Richard Field suggests the white tiare flower behind her left ear indicates she is seeking a husband.  Behind her a second figure in a high-necked Western-style dress sits erectly. Field thought her gesture derives from Buddhist art. Naomi E. Maurer subsequently identified it as a  mudra denoting threatening or warning. The front woman stretches herself, her facial features stylized and simplified. Field thought her pose had a Japanese precedent, Charles F. Stuckey suggests Delacroix's Women of Algiers. The rear female figure is flush with the yellow-blue area. Her face is painted with individual features and represents the centre of the image. The pink colour of her dress is clearly distinct from the other colours. At the bottom right is the inscription \"NAFEA Faa ipoipo\" (When will you marry). Gauguin commonly inscribed his paintings in Tahitian at this time: he was fascinated by the language, though never advanced beyond its rudiments.\nArt historian Nancy Mowll Mathews wrote that Gauguin \"portrayed the  natives as living only to sing and to make love. That's how he got the money from his friends and raised the public's interest in his adventure. But, of course, he knew the truth, which was that Tahiti was an unremarkable island with an international, westernised community\". These paintings of Tahitians, including When Will You Marry?, were met with relative indifference when Gauguin returned to France, his 1893 Durand-Ruel exhibition only a limited success generating some favourable reviews but little by way of sales. Gauguin placed this painting on consignment at the exhibition at a price of 1,500 francs, the highest price he assigned and shared by only one other painting, but had no takers. Staechelin eventually purchased it at the Maison Moos gallery in Geneva in 1917.\nA pencil sketch of the painting's central figure was uncovered and authenticated in a 2017 episode of Fake or Fortune? \nPencil sketch, 1892, Art Institute of Chicago\nTwo Tahitian Women in a Landscape, circa 1892, Art Institute of Chicago\nTahitian Scene, circa 1892, Thiel Gallery\nBlack Pigs with Crouching Tahitian (W 445), 1891, Private collection\nWhere Are You Going?, 1893, Hermitage Museum\n"

Griffin, who purchased it in September 2015 from David Geffen for $200 million, a then record-breaking price, at which time it was lent to the Art Institute of Chicago. As of September 2022, it is ranked 5th on the list of most expensive paintings.\nThe painting is oil paint on fiberboard and is a drip painting, created by splashing paint onto a horizontal surface. It was painted a year after Jackson Pollock introduced his drip technique. The piece was featured in the August 1949 edition of Life that made Jackson Pollock a celebrity.\nThis article about a twentieth-century painting is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

    "painting_info": "Water Serpents II, also referred to as Wasserschlangen II, is an oil painting made by Gustav Klimt in 1907. It is the follow-up painting to the earlier painting Water Serpents I. Like the first painting, Water Serpents II deals with the sensuality of women's bodies and same-sex relationships. The painting has a rich history. During World War II, it was stolen by the Nazis, and more recently, it has been the center of a controversy surrounding its record 2013 sale. As of December 2019, it is the 6th most expensive painting in the world and the most expensive work by Klimt to sell.\nThe painting is an oil on canvas. It was started by Klimt in 1904 and finished in either 1906 or 1907. It was originally commissioned for and owned by Jenny Steiner, the daughter of a Viennese industrialist. The painting was the last in a series of works, which include Moving Water (1898), Medicine (1901), Goldfish (1902), and Water Serpents I (1904), that all had water nymphs as the subjects of the painting.\nThe painting features a group of four water nymphs, portrayed in lustful bliss. Two are seen in the foreground in full nudity; the other two can be found in the top right corner of the piece, and only their heads are visible. The painting can be seen as a non-controversial portrayal of mythical figures, which had been common in art for centuries. But it has also been interpreted as a depiction of a lesbian orgy. According to this interpretation, since same-sex relationships were not acceptable at the time, Klimt disguised the women as mythical figures. This is supported by the fact that the main character’s pubic hair is showing, and she is glaring sensually at the viewer. This glare is reminiscent of the way the subject glares at the viewer in the painting Olympia by Manet. This painting, and its lesbian subjects, is seen as a precursor to later Klimt paintings such as Women Friends (1917), which displayed lesbian relationships more openly.\nThe painting's owner, Jenny Steiner, was Jewish, and she was forced to flee Vienna to Portugal in 1938 under threat from the Nazis. Following Steiner's escape, the painting, like many others owned by Jews, was confiscated by the Nazis. It was given to a Nazi filmmaker named Gustav Ucicky. Ucicky is actually rumored to be one of Klimt's many illegitimate children.\nFollowing the end of the war, Ucicky retained possession of the painting, and it hung on a wall in his apartment in Vienna. In 1961, Ucicky died, and he left the painting to his wife, Ursula. This whole time, the painting was considered lost.\nIn 2012, Ursula Ucicky put the painting up for sale with Sotheby’s Auction House acting as the broker. Because the painting was still considered stolen art, Ursula had to come to an agreement with the heirs of Jenny Steiner, the rightful owner of the painting, in order to obtain an export license for the painting. The agreement, which was mediated by the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien, or Vienesse Jewish Community, stipulated that the proceeds would be split 50/50 between Ursula and the heirs. That same year, the painting was sold to art broker Yves Bouvier for $112 million, which meant each party received around $56 million. The heirs of Jenny Steiner used their portion of the proceeds to found the New Klimt Foundation.\nIn 2013 Yves Bouvier sold the painting to the Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, one of the largest private art collectors in the world. As he did to many other wealthy collectors, Bouvier tricked Rybololev. Bouvier didn't tell Rybolovlev that he was actually the owner of the painting and had paid $112 million for it. Instead, Bouvier made it seem like the painting was still owned by a third party and convinced Rybolovlev that the painting was worth much more than $112 million. In the end, Rybolovlev paid $183.3 million for the painting, plus an additional $3.7 million administrative fee. This means that Bouvier made a profit of $75 million by tricking Rybolovlev. Eventually, the deceit was uncovered. Rybolovlev, along with Bouvier's many other victims, has brought charges and lawsuits against Bouvier. As of 2019, the litigation was still ongoing.\nIn 2015, the painting was once again sold by Rybolovlev. This time, it was sold for $170 million to an undisclosed buyer. The painting is rumored to be in the private collection of an unnamed Qatari Princess. As of October 2022, the painting is exhibited at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam as part of the \"Golden Boy - Gustav Klimt\" exhibition.\n"

It was painted in 1951.\nIn common with Rothko's other works from this period, No. 6 consists of large expanses of colour delineated by uneven, hazy shades. In 2014, it became one of the most expensive paintings sold at auction.\nNo.6 (Violet, Green and Red) is one of the works implicated in the infamous Bouvier Affair. It was privately bought for €140 million by Dmitry Rybolovlev  in 2014. Rybolovlev is thought to have bought the painting via the Swiss dealer, Bouvier. Rybolovlev learnt that Bouvier had actually bought the painting (rather than simply acting as a dealer) from Paiker H.B. for ~€80,000,000 before selling it on to Rybolovlev for €140,000,000.\n"

    "short_description": "Pair of paintings by Rembrandt",
    "painting_info": "The pendant  portraits of Marten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit are a pair of full-length wedding portraits by Rembrandt.  They were painted on the occasion of the marriage of Marten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit in 1634. Formerly owned by the Rothschild family, they became jointly owned by the Louvre Museum and the Rijksmuseum in 2015 after both museums managed to contribute half of the purchase price of €160 million, a record for works by Rembrandt.\nThe portraits were painted by Rembrandt upon the occasion of the wedding of Marten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit in 1634. Although the subjects were painted individually, the portraits have been kept together since their inception. Unlike many 17th-century portrait pairs, these two have always hung side by side in various collections based in Amsterdam or Paris. They are also unusual in Rembrandt's oeuvre for their size and the fact that they show the subjects at full length. Appearing in period inventories at regular intervals since their creation, together they form part of Rembrandt's core oeuvre against which other paintings with a more questionable lineage are compared. The subjects Marten Soolmans and his wife Oopjen Coppit are dressed as befits a pair of wealthy Amsterdam newlyweds. Though most in the art world agree these paintings should remain together, it became impossible for France to keep them within its borders, as the Louvre was unable to guarantee the necessary funding required to keep the ministry of culture from providing an export permit. The paintings have not been declared French national heritage.\nPortrait of Marten Soolmans (1613-1641) was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1915, who wrote:\n637 MAERTEN DAEY (1604-after 1650). Sm. 340.; Bode 303; Dut. 208; Wb. 316; B.-HdG. 107. Full length; life size. About thirty. He is seen almost in full face. He walks a little to the right on the parti-coloured stone floor, at the back of which is a step. He wears a very rich black costume, consisting of a coat with large stripes, breeches, and a short cloak of the same material, a broad and close-fitting lace collar, smooth cuffs, rosettes of lace at his waistband and on his shoes, and white stockings, with bows of rich lace on his garters. A broad-brimmed black slouch hat covers his thick fair hair; he has a plump and beardless face. His right hand rests on his hip under the cloak; his out-stretched left hand holds a glove. In the right background is a bluish-green curtain. \nSigned on the left at foot, \"Rembrandt f. 1634\"; canvas, 82 inches by 52 inches. Etched by L. Flameng in the Gazette des Beaux-Arts, 1879; in the Nederlandsche Kunstbode, 1879, p. 2; and in Dutuit. Mentioned by Vosmaer, pp. 145, 502; Bode, p. 402; Dutuit, p. 52; Michel, p. 148 ; Moes, 1881. Exhibited at Amsterdam 1867, No. 161.\n\nSale. Hendrik Daey, Alkmaar, 1798 (4000 florins, with pendant, R. M. Pruyssenaar and Adriaen Daey, who sold the pair to Van Winter for 12,000 florins). In the Van Winter collection, Amsterdam, which passed by inheritance to the Van Loons. In the Van Loon collection, Amsterdam; sold as a whole in 1877 to the Rothschilds. In the collection of Baron Gustave de Rothschild, Paris. In the collection of Baron Robert de Rothschild, Paris.Portrait of Oopjen Coppit (1611-1689) was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1915, who wrote:\n638 MACHTELD VAN DOORN (1605-1646), from 1629 the wife of Martin Daey. Sm. 551.; Bode 304; Dut. 209; Wb. 317; B.-HdG. 108. Full length; life size. About thirty. She walks to the left along a footpath paved with stones, and looks at the spectator. She holds up in her right hand, by a gold chain, a rich fan of black ostrich feathers; with her left hand, as she descends a step, she lightly raises her handsome spotted gown of black silk with a high bodice, against which her broad and close-fitting lace collar and her lace-trimmed wristbands stand out in relief. At her waistband and on her shoe are rosettes of lace. Her fair curls are caught up at the back in a cap; a thick black veil falls from it down her back. At her throat and on her arms are several strings of pearls, and there is a pearl in each ear. A gold ring hangs by a fine chain from her lace collar. In the right background is a bluish-green curtain. \nSigned, \"Rembrandt f. 1634\"; canvas, 82 inches by 52 inches. Etched by L. Flameng in the Gazette des Beaux-Arts, 1879; in Dutuit; and in the Nederlandsche Kunstbode, 1879. Mentioned by Vosmaer, pp. 254, 533; Bode, p. 402; Dutuit, p. 52; Michel, p. 148 ; Moes, 2075. Exhibited at Amsterdam, 1867, No. 162. Sale. Hendrik Daey, Alkmaar, 1798 (4000 florins, with pendant, R. M. Pruyssenaar and Adriaen Daey, who sold the pictures for 12,000 florins to Van Winter).\n\nIn the Van Winter collection, Amsterdam, which passed by inheritance to the Van Loons, and was acquired as a whole in 1877 by the Rothschilds. In the collection of Baron Gustave de Rothschild, Paris. In the collection of Baron Robert de Rothschild, Paris.Oopjen is wearing a flat lace collar with matching wrist collars in the latest fashion. Other Amsterdam brides of the regency class wore millstone collars well into the 1640s. She is also wearing a pearl necklace and a pearl bracelet, and pearls were considered more valuable than diamonds at that time. The format of the paintings showing the couple at full length was the most expensive form of marriage pendant and could only fit in a house with high ceilings. According to family inventories, they also owned another Rembrandt depicting the Holy Family. It is assumed that this is the Holy Family now in Munich, as that is also dated to 1634.\nThe paintings were known as the \"Portrait of Meneer Day\" and \"Portrait of Mevrouw Day\" for over a century. He and his wife, who married 9 June 1633,\nwere only properly identified in the 20th-century. The confusion of the names came about because after Marten died, Oopjen remarried Captain Maerten Pietersz. Daij, and she outlived this second husband as well. After her death the paintings remained in the Daij or Daey family and members of that family assumed the portraits were of Daij and his first wife.\nThe joint purchase of these paintings was made by the Rijksmuseum and the Louvre on February 1, 2016. For the first time since 60 years, they were exhibited at the Louvre on March 10, 2016 until June 13, then for another 3 months at the Rijksmuseum, before their restoration. The intergovernmental agreement will keep these pendants together, alternately at the Louvre again, then at the Rijksmuseum for five years, followed by periods of eight years. They consequently may not be lent to other institutions.\nThe portraits were in the possession of the subjects' heirs until their sale in 1877 to Gustave Samuel de Rothschild, a French banker. They were lent for exhibition once only, to the Rijksmuseum in 1956 for the artist's 350th birthday. Before being sold, they were hung in a large hall in the Van Loon collection, described by Eugène Fromentin in 1877 with the remark that they were examples of Rembrandt at his best and were painted in the same period that Rembrandt painted his Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp, traditionally marking the beginning of his career in Amsterdam. Clearly, the flamboyance of these young newlyweds did more to launch Rembrandt's career as a portrait painter for the Amsterdam upper class than his sober depiction of a class of serious students in Leiden. The entire Van Loon collection was sold to Rothschild for 40,000 pounds, which at the time was over a million francs.\nWilhelm von Bode was impressed enough to include both in his set of 595 photogravures for his eight-volume 1898 treatise on Rembrandt. Fromentin and Bode had identified the paintings as  portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Daey, but it was the Amsterdam historian Isabella Henriette van Eeghen who painstakingly traced their ownership to their original inventories and established the identities of the portrayed.\nThe current joined ownership is a new arrangement for the Louvre and Rijksmuseum, and it remains to be seen whether this experiment in international art purchasing will fit into exhibition plans of both institutions. Unlike many expensive paintings, these two will not be restricted by location and it is expected that they will be on tour regularly. According to Wim Pijbes, director of the Rijksmuseum, the paintings will not be separated, and each museum will own 50 percent of each painting.\nThe previous record for a pair of paintings was for two Titians, his Diana and Callisto and Diana and Actaeon, that also hang side by side and are today joinedly owned by the National Gallery and the National Galleries of Scotland. The previous record for a painting purchase at the Rijksmuseum was for A Mayor of Delft and his Daughter by Jan Steen, for which they paid 11.9 million euro's in July 2004. The most expensive Rembrandt portrait sold before these is Portrait of a Foreign Admiral, sold at Christie's in December 2009 for £20 million.\n1632\n1632\n1632\n1633\n1633\n1633\n1634\nc.1639\n"

    "short_description": "Painting series by Pablo Picasso",
    "painting_info": "Les Femmes d'Alger (English: Women of Algiers) is a series of 15 paintings and numerous drawings by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. The series, created in 1954–1955, was inspired by Eugène Delacroix's 1834 painting The Women of Algiers in their Apartment (French: Femmes d'Alger dans leur appartement). The series is one of several painted by Picasso in tribute to artists that he admired.\nThe entire series of Les Femmes d'Alger was bought by Victor and Sally Ganz from the Galerie Louise Leiris in Paris for $212,500 in June 1956 (equivalent to $2.1 million in 2021). Ten paintings from the series were later sold by the Ganz's to the Saidenberg Gallery, with the couple keeping versions \"C\", \"H\", \"K\", \"M\" and \"O\".\nMany of the individual paintings in the series are now in prominent public and private collections.\nIn December 1954, Picasso began to paint a series of free variations on Delacroix's The Women of Algiers in their Apartment (Les Femmes d'Alger). He began his first version (cat. 19) six weeks after learning of the death of his lifelong friend and rival Henri Matisse—and so, for Picasso, the \"oriental\" subject of this series of paintings held strong associations with Matisse as well as with Delacroix. Matisse had been famous for his images of languid, voluptuous women known as odalisques—the French form of the Turkish word for women in a harem. \"When Matisse died he left his odalisques to me as a legacy,\" joked Picasso. Many of Picasso's portrayals of Jacqueline circa 1955–56 represent her in this guise (cat. 9).\nThe consequences of Picasso's Femmes d'Alger series were far-reaching: \"I thought so much about Les Femmes d'Alger that I bought La Californie,\" Picasso explained to his biographer Pierre Daix. La Californie is a Belle Époque villa situated in the foothills of Cannes in the South of France, where Picasso spent his last decades. Picasso bought it in 1955, and it was here that he painted the Nude in a Rocking-Chair (cat. 16). The light-filled interiors, the views over the Mediterranean and the exotic garden evoked a feeling of spaciousness and ease which corresponded to Picasso's idea of the Orient.\nThe art historian and collector Douglas Cooper was perhaps the first to realise that the paintings done at La Californie marked a return to Picasso's peak form. In April 1956, he wrote to the curator Alfred H. Barr Jr.:\nI recently spent the day with Picasso and went through most of what he has done since last July. I have been greatly impressed...A whole series of interiors of La Californie deriving half from Delacroix half from Matisse—great emphasis on ornament, arabesque, simplification...In short, as you are planning to come to Europe, this is a word to tell you that you must see all this in the studio: it is to my mind much better than anything since 1946.\n\"Version C\" was sold in 1988 following Victor Ganz's death.\n\"Version F\" was completed on 17 February 1955, and later sold to Daniel and Eleanore Saidenberg of the Saidenberg Gallery in 1957. It was subsequently sold to a private collector in 2011. The painting later was sold for $29.22 million on 10 July 2020, as part of the New York leg of the One: A Global Sale of the 20th Century auction of Christie's.\n\"Version H\" was completed on 24 January 1955, and was in sold for $7.15 million in November 1997, as part of the Ganz collection, at Christie's in New York. It is part of the Nahmad Collection in Switzerland. In May 2015, it was on loan to Tate Liverpool, England.\n\"Version J\" was sold at Sotheby's in London in 2006 for $18.6 million and is part of the Nahmad Collection.\n\"Version K\" sold for $6.6 million in November 1997, as part of the Ganz collection, at Christie's in New York.\n\"Version L\" was bought by the Berggruen Museum in Berlin in 2011 for $21.4 million.\n\"Version M\" sold for $10 million in November 1997, as part of the Ganz collection, at Christie's in New York.\n\"Version N\" is held by the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum at Washington University in St. Louis, and was bought by the Steinberg Fund, for the university, in 1960.\n\"Version O\", the final painting in the series, was painted in 1955.\nThe painting sold for $31.9 million in November 1997, as part of the Ganz collection, at Christie's in New York. Three other versions in the series owned by the Ganz family were also auctioned at the same time. \"Version O\" was bought, by the British art dealer Libby Howie, for an undisclosed Saudi Arabian collector living in London.\n\"Version O\" was auctioned at Christie's New York for a second time in May 2015, selling for $179.4 million including fees, a record price for a painting at auction. It was bought by the former Qatari prime minister, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani. The most expensive work of art to previously sell at auction, Francis Bacon's painting Three Studies of Lucian Freud, had sold for $142.4 million in 2013.  \"Version O\" remained the most expensive painting ever sold at auction until it was surpassed by Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi in November 2017. It maintained the auction-sale record for a 20th century painting until May 2022, when Andy Warhol's Shot Sage Blue Marilyn sold at Christie's for $195 million.\n"

    "painting_info": "The Standard Bearer is a three-quarter-length self-portrait by Rembrandt formerly in the Paris collection of Elie de Rothschild, and purchased by the Rijksmuseum for 175 million euros with assistance from the Dutch state and Vereniging Rembrandt in 2021.  It was painted on the occasion of the artist's move from Leiden to Amsterdam and is seen as an important early work that \"shows Rembrandt's ambition to paint a group portrait for the Amsterdam militia, at the time the most valued commission a painter could be awarded.\"\nRembrandt's flag bearer has several copies in oil, and later prints may be from such copies, but this painting nevertheless has a provenance reaching far into the 18th-century. It was documented as a self-portrait by Smith in 1836, who wrote: \nRembrandt in the character of a Standard-Bearer. His portly countenance, which is seen in nearly a front view, denotes him to have been about fifty years of age; a large hat, turned up at the side, and decked with feathers, covers his head, and a steel cuirass shields his breast: the remainder of his habiliments are suitably rich and appropriate. One hand grasps the staff of an unfurled banner, and the other is placed on his side. This splendidly-coloured picture is engraved by Lause, and also by G. Haid. From the collection of Chevalier Verhulst, M. le Boeuf and M. Robit. It was afterwards in the collection of his Majesty George IV., who exchanged it with M. Lafontaine for other pictures.Cornelis Hofstede de Groot agreed with him in 1914, but stopped short of calling it a self-portrait. He wrote:\n270 A STANDARD-BEARER. Sm. 201, and Suppl. 23 ; Bode 300 ; Dut. 148 ; Wb. 313 ; B.-HdG. 206.\nHe stands in profile to the right, turning his face round and looking at the spectator. With his left hand he holds a large white banner on his shoulder ; his right hand is on his hip. Over his brown curls he wears a slashed cap with a brown plume ; his face is shaved, save for the long moustache. Over his yellowish-brown coat, trimmed with lace, he wears an iron gorget and a broad sash from which a sword hangs at his side. He has loose sleeves and a white collar and wrist-bands. Strong light from the left touches his back and his face and falls full on the banner. Life size, three-quarter length.

The museum was unable to do so and waived its right of first refusal for purchase. In December 2021, the Dutch state announced its intention to buy the work for the national collection.\nAs result, the Rothschild family sold the painting to the Netherlands for €175 million in 2022. The Dutch government paid €150 million, while the Rembrandt Association and the Rijksmuseum contributed a total of €25 million. It was bought from the Rothschild family, who had owned it since 1844, via a trust located in the tax haven of the Cook Islands. The Standard Bearer is to tour every province in the Netherlands before going on display at the Rijksmuseum's Gallery of Honour. It was acquired during the COVID-19 pandemic amid media coverage of failing income for the Netherlands' cultural sector.

    "painting_info": "Shot Marilyns is a series of silkscreen paintings produced in 1964 by Andy Warhol, each canvas measuring 40 inches square, and each a portrait of Marilyn Monroe.\nPop artist Andy Warhol had a fascination with Hollywood and fame. A legend of the silver screen, Marilyn Monroe is widely considered to be the epitome of Hollywood glamour. After her death at the age of 36 in August 1962, Warhol began immortalizing her in his work. \"In August '62 I started doing silkscreens.... It was all so simple-quick and chancy. I was thrilled with it. My first experiments with screens were heads of Troy Donahue and Warren Beatty, and then when Marilyn Monroe happened to die that month, I got the idea to make screens of her beautiful face — the first Marilyns.\"\nIn 1964, Warhol created portraits of Monroe based on a publicity photo for her 1953 film Niagara. He painted five Marilyn silkscreen portraits with different colored backgrounds: red, orange, light blue, sage blue, and turquoise, and stored them at The Factory, his studio on East 47th Street in Manhattan.\nDorothy Podber, a performance artist and friend of Factory photographer Billy Name, saw the recently completed paintings stacked against one another at the studio and asked Warhol if she could shoot them. Believing that she intended to photograph the paintings, Warhol agreed. Podber doffed her pair of black gloves, withdrew a small revolver from her purse, and fired a shot into the stack of four paintings, which became known as The Shot Marilyns. The fifth painting with the turquoise background was not in the stack.\nIn the 2002 documentary How to Draw a Bunny, Name described this event as a \"performance piece\" by Podber. After she had shot the paintings and left, Andy Warhol purportedly asked Name to please ask Podber not to do that again. She was, however, henceforth barred from The Factory for life.\nBlue Shot Marilyn was purchased by Peter Brant for $5,000 in 1967.\nShot Red Marilyn was sold to Masao Wanibuchi for $4.1 million at Christie's in 1989. In the midst of an art market recession, he sold it at a loss to Philip Niarchos for $3.6 million in 1994.\nOrange Marilyn was bought for $17.3 million by Si Newhouse in 1998. After his death, Kenneth C. Griffin purchased it for around $200 million in 2017.\nTurquoise Marilyn was bought by Steve Cohen in 2007 for a rumored $80 million.\nShot Sage Blue Marilyn was auctioned by Christie's in New York City on May 9, 2022. It sold for $195 million from the Foundation of Thomas and Doris Ammann. This sale greatly extended the record for a price paid at auction for a work by an American artist set by Jean-Michel Basquiat's 1982 painting Untitled, which sold for $110.5 million in 2017. It also set the mark for the most expensive work of 20th century art sold in a public sale.\nThe  purchaser was the American art dealer Larry Gagosian.  It has not been disclosed as of yet whether he was buying the work for himself or a secondary party.\n"

    "painting_info": "Nu couché (also known in English as Red Nude or Reclining Nude) is a 1917 oil on canvas painting by the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani. It is one of his most widely reproduced and exhibited paintings.\nThe painting realized $170,405,000 at a Christie's New York sale on 9 November 2015, a record for a Modigliani painting and placing it high among the most expensive paintings ever sold. The purchaser was the Chinese businessman Liu Yiqian. Liu is believed to have paid for the painting using his American Express card.\nThe painting is one of a famous series of nudes that Modigliani painted in 1917 under the patronage of his Polish dealer Léopold Zborowski. It is believed to have been included in Modigliani's first and only art show in 1917, at the Galerie Berthe Weill, which was shut down by the police. Christie's lot notes for their November 2015 sale of the painting observed that this group of nudes by Modigliani served to reaffirm and reinvigorate the nude as a subject of modernist art.\nThis article about a twentieth-century painting is a stub.

    "painting_info": "No. 5, 1948 is a painting by Jackson Pollock, an American painter known for his contributions to the abstract expressionist movement. It was sold on 22 May 2006 for $140 million, a new mark for highest ever price for a painting, not surpassed until April 2011.\n\nThe painting was created on fibreboard, also known as composition board, measuring 8’ x 4’. For the paint, Pollock chose to use liquid paints. More specifically, they were synthetic resin paints (gloss enamel) but are referred to as oil paints for classification of the work. On inspection it was grey, brown, white and yellow paint drizzled in a way that many people still perceive as a \"dense bird’s nest\". Initial reactions to the work were underwhelming:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}\"You spent money on 'that'?\" \nThe initial reaction of Ted Dragon, Ossorio's partner.The painting has been modified by Pollock since it was originally created. During January 1949, it was being shown in a solo Pollock show at the Betty Parsons gallery. It was from here that Alfonso A. Ossorio decided to purchase a \"paint drip\" composition; he chose No. 5, 1948 and paid $1,500. It was the only canvas sold from the show. At some point, presumably during the moving process, the painting became damaged, according to Grace Hartigan. \"Home Sweet Home  came in with a painting in one hand and a lump of paint from the center of the painting in the other hand\". Hartigan gave Pollock some paint and he patched the painting before it went to Ossorio, saying \"He’ll never know, never know\". When the painting was subsequently delivered to Ossorio, he claimed that he noticed \"a portion of the paint - actually the skin from the top of an opened paint can - had slid\" leaving a \"nondescript smear amidst the surrounding linear clarity,\" as he explained in a 1978 lecture at Yale. Pollock offered to rework the painting but, according to Hartigan, he \"repainted the whole thing again\" and stated that \"He'll never know. No one knows how to look at my paintings, he won’t know the difference.\" After three weeks, Ossorio visited Pollock's studio to inspect the painting. Ossorio was confronted with an artwork which was repainted onto fiberboard, with \"new qualities of richness and depth\" as a result of Pollock's \"thorough but subtle repainting.\" It was clear that Ossorio still liked the painting despite the rework, and continued to attest that the \"original concept remained unmistakably present, but affirmed and fulfilled by a new complexity and depth of linear interplay. It was, and still is a masterful display of control and disciplined vision.\" Pollock repaired the damage to the painting by completely repainting the original, in contrast to how other artworks are repaired. The reconstruction had not only retained but reinforced the metaphysical concept of the painting, and has become what Ossorio calls \"a wonderful example of an artist having a second chance\".\nAccording to a report in The New York Times on November 2, 2006, the painting was sold by David Geffen, founder of Geffen Records and co-founder of DreamWorks SKG, to David Martinez, managing partner of Fintech Advisory Ltd, in a private sale for a record inflation-adjusted price of $140 million. It is speculated that Geffen sold the painting, along with two others, to raise enough funds to bid for the Los Angeles Times. \nThe sale was reportedly brokered by Sotheby's auctioneer Tobias Meyer, however, the law firm of Shearman & Sterling, LLP, issued a press release on behalf of its client, David Martinez, to announce that contrary to recent articles in the press, Martinez does not own the painting or any rights to acquire it. In addition to the refutation issued by Shearman & Sterling, the auction expert Josh Baer indicated that Martinez was not the buyer of the painting.\nThe lyrics of The Stone Roses song \"Going Down\" include a reference to the painting: \"(There) she looks like a painting - Jackson Pollock's Number 5...\"  The Stone Roses' guitarist John Squire created cover artwork for many of the band's releases on Silvertone Records in a style similar to that of Jackson Pollock.\nThe painting played a central role in the film  Ex Machina (2015), in which billionaire tech firm CEO Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac) owns the painting and uses it as an object lesson for the protagonist Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson), noting that No. 5, 1948 would never have come into existence if Jackson Pollock only painted what he already knew.  This is contrasted to the way an AI comes to know, thus emphasizing the problem of consciousness and epistemology.\n"

Finally, in 1994, the painting was acquired by collector Thomas Ammann and subsequently traded to collector David Geffen for part of a 16th century Persian manuscript, the Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp.\nIn November 2006, the painting was sold by Geffen to billionaire Steven A. Cohen for $137.5 million.  It is currently the fourteenth most expensive painting ever bought, and the only of de Koonings early Woman series not held in a public collection.\n\nThis article about a twentieth-century painting is a stub.

    "painting_info": "\nMasterpiece is a 1962 pop art painting by Roy Lichtenstein that uses his classic Ben-Day dots and narrative content contained within a speech balloon. In 2017 the painting sold for $165 million.\nAccording to the Lichtenstein Foundation website, Masterpiece was part of Lichtenstein's first exhibition at Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles from April 1 – April 27, 1963, featuring Drowning Girl, Portrait of Madame Cézanne and other works from 1962 and 1963. When discussing another work (I Know...Brad), Lichtenstein stated that the name Brad sounded heroic to him and was used with the aim of clichéd oversimplification. Drowning Girl is another notable work with Brad as the heroic subject.\nThe source of this image was a comic book panel with the two subjects positioned similarly to their position here, but they were situated in an automobile. In the source image the narrative content of the speech balloon said \"But someday the bitterness will pass...\"\nMasterpiece was part of the largest ever retrospective of Lichtenstein that visited The Art Institute of Chicago from May 16 to September 3, 2012, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. from October 14, 2012 to January 13, 2013, the Tate Modern in London from February 21 to May 27, 2013 and The Centre Pompidou from July 3 to November 4, 2013. Several publications presented Masterpiece as part of their announcement of the retrospective.\nIn January 2017, Agnes Gund sold the 1962 painting Masterpiece, which for years hung over the mantle of her Upper East Side apartment, for $165 million. The proceeds of the sale will be used to start a fund for criminal justice reform called the Art for Justice fund. The price was one of the 15 highest ever to be paid for an artwork. The purchaser was Steven A. Cohen.\nMasterpiece is regarded as a tongue in cheek joke that reflects upon Lichtenstein's own career. In retrospect, the joke is considered \"witty and yet eerily prescient\" because it portended some of the future turmoil that the artist would endure. In the painting,  the blonde female's speech bubble, \"Why, Brad darling, This painting is a masterpiece! My, soon you'll have all of New York clamoring for your work!\" conveys her remark as she gazes at the painting, of which a corner of the back is shown. Silent Brad conveys his agreement by his facial expression. Adrian Searle of The Guardian says that the 1962 work, whose narrative and graphical content were both borrowed, was timely because Lichtenstein had his first exhibition in New York City at Leo Castelli Gallery that year, making the painting aspirational in an ironic way that comments on success and \"the socio-sexual status of the hot young artist\". The satirical commentary on Lichtenstein's career, followed the inside joke made the year before in Mr. Bellamy. According to Roberta Smith of The New York Times, Masterpiece was one of Lichtenstein's works created in a way that produced \"faint and uneven\" Ben Day dots.\n"

    "painting_info": "\nPortrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I (also called The Lady in Gold or The Woman in Gold) is a painting by Gustav Klimt, completed between 1903 and 1907. The portrait was commissioned by the sitter's husband, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer , a Jewish banker and sugar producer. The painting was stolen by the Nazis in 1941 and displayed at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere in Vienna. The portrait is the final and most fully representative work of Klimt's golden phase. It was the first of two depictions of Adele by Klimt—the second was completed in 1912; these were two of several works by the artist that the family owned.\nAdele died in 1925; her will asked that the artworks by Klimt be left to the Galerie Belvedere after Ferdinand's death, although these belonged to Ferdinand, not to Adele. Following the 1938 Anschluss of Austria by Nazi Germany, Ferdinand fled Vienna's increasingly anti-Jewish persecutions, and made his way to Switzerland, leaving behind much of his wealth, including his large art collection. The painting was stolen by the Nazis in 1941, along with the remainder of Ferdinand's assets, after a charge of tax evasion was made against him. The assets raised from the purported sales of artwork, property and his sugar business were offset against the tax claim. The lawyer acting on behalf of the German state gave the portrait to the Galerie Belvedere, claiming he was following the wishes Adele had made in her will. Ferdinand died in 1945; his will stated that his estate should go to his nephew and two nieces.\nIn 1998 Hubertus Czernin, the Austrian investigative journalist, established that the Galerie Belvedere contained several works stolen from Jewish owners in the war, and that the gallery had refused to return the art to their original owners, or to acknowledge a theft had taken place. One of Ferdinand's nieces, Maria Altmann, hired the lawyer E. Randol Schoenberg to make a claim against the gallery for the return of five works by Klimt. In 2006 after a seven-year legal claim, which included a hearing in front of the Supreme Court of the United States, an arbitration committee in Vienna agreed that the painting, and others, had been stolen from the family and that it should be returned to Altmann. She sold it the same year for $135 million, at the time a record price for a painting to the businessman and art collector Ronald Lauder, who placed the work in the Neue Galerie, the New York-based gallery he co-founded.\nGustav Klimt was born in 1862 in Baumgarten, near Vienna in Austria-Hungary. He attended the Vienna School of Arts and Crafts (German: Kunstgewerbeschule Wien) before taking on commissions with his brother, Ernst, and a fellow-student Franz von Matsch from 1879. Over the next decade, alongside several private commissions for portraiture, they painted interior murals and ceilings in large public buildings, including the Burgtheater, the Kunsthistorisches Museum and the ceiling of the Great Hall at the University of Vienna.\nKlimt worked in Vienna during the Belle Époque, during which time the city made \"an extreme and lasting contribution to the history of modern art\". During the 1890s he was influenced by European avant-garde art, including the works of the painters Fernand Khnopff, Jan Toorop and Aubrey Beardsley. In 1897 he was a founding member and president of the Vienna Secession, a group of artists who wanted to break with what they saw as the prevailing conservatism of the Viennese Künstlerhaus. Klimt in particular challenged what he saw as the \"hypocritical boundaries of respectability set by Viennese society\"; according to the art historian Susanna Partsch, he was \"the enfant terrible of the Viennese art scene,  was acknowledged to be the painter of beautiful women\". By 1900 he was the preferred portrait painter of the wives of the largely Jewish Viennese bourgeoisie, an emerging class of self-made industrialists who were \"buying the innovative new art that state museums rejected\", according to the journalist Anne-Marie O'Connor.\nFrom 1898 Klimt began to experiment with the style in what became known as his Byzantine or Golden period, when his works, stylistically influenced by Art Nouveau and the Arts and Crafts movement, were gilded with gold leaf. Klimt had begun using gold in his 1890 portrait of the pianist Joseph Pembauer, but his first work that included a golden theme was Pallas Athene (1898). The art historian Gilles Néret considers that the use of gold in the painting \"underlines the essential erotic ingredient in ...  view of the world\". Néret also states that Klimt used the gold to give subjects a sacred or magical quality.\nAdele Bauer  was from a wealthy Jewish Viennese family. Her father was a director of the Wiener Bankverein, the seventh largest bank in Austria-Hungary, and the general director of the Oriental Railway. In the late 1890s Adele met Klimt, and may have begun a relationship with him. Opinion is divided on whether Adele and Klimt had an affair. The artist Catherine Dean considered that Adele was \"the only society lady painted by Klimt who is known definitely to be his mistress\", while the journalist Melissa Müller and the academic Monica Tatzkow write that \"no evidence has ever been produced that their relationship was more than a friendship\". The author Frank Whitford observes that some of the preliminary sketches that Klimt made for The Kiss showed a bearded figure which was possibly a self-portrait; the female partner is described by Whitford as an \"idealised portrait of Adele\". Whitford writes that the only evidence put forward to support the theory is the position of the woman's right hand, as Adele had a disfigured finger following a childhood accident.\nAdele's parents arranged a marriage with Ferdinand Bloch, a banker and sugar manufacturer; Adele's older sister had previously married Ferdinand's older brother. Ferdinand was older than his fiancée and at the time of the marriage in December 1899, she was 18 and he was 35. The couple, who had no children, both changed their surnames to Bloch-Bauer. Socially well-connected, Adele brought together writers, politicians and intellectuals for regular salons at their home.\nThe couple shared a love of art, and patronised several artists, collecting primarily nineteenth-century Viennese paintings and modern sculpture. Ferdinand also had a passion for neoclassical porcelain, and by 1934 his collection was over 400 pieces and one of the finest in the world.\nIn 1901 Klimt painted Judith and the Head of Holofernes; the art historian Gottfried Fliedl observes that the painting is \"widely known and interpreted as Salome\". Adele was the model for the work, and wore a heavily jewelled deep choker given to her by Ferdinand, in what Whitford describes as \"Klimt's most erotic painting\". Whitford also writes that the painting displays \"apparent evidence of ... cuckoldry\". In 1903 Ferdinand purchased his first Klimt work from the artist, Buchenwald (Beech Forest).\nIn mid-1903 Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer commissioned Klimt to paint a portrait of his wife; he wished to give the piece to Adele's parents as an anniversary present that October. Klimt drew over a hundred preparatory sketches for the portrait between 1903 and 1904. The Bloch-Bauers purchased some of the sketches he had made of Adele when they obtained 16 Klimt drawings. In December 1903, along with fellow artist Maximilian Lenz, Klimt visited the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna where he studied the early-Christian Byzantine gold ground mosaics of Justinian I and his wife, Empress Theodora. Lenz later wrote that \"the mosaics made an immense decisive impression on ... . From this comes the resplendence, the stiff decoration of his art\". Klimt later said that the \"mosaics of unbelievable splendour\" were a \"revelation\" to him. The Ravenna mosaics also attracted the attention of other artists who provided illustrations of the work, including Wassily Kandinsky in 1911 and Clive Bell in 1914.\nKlimt undertook more extensive preparations for the portrait than any other piece he worked on.  Much of the portrait was undertaken by an elaborate technique of using gold and silver leaf and then adding decorative motifs in bas-relief using gesso, a paint mixture consisting of a binder mixed with chalk or gypsum. The frame for the painting, covered in gold leaf, was made by the architect Josef Hoffmann. Klimt finished the work by 1907.\nThe painting measures 138 by 138 cm (54 by 54 in); it is composed of oil paint and silver and gold leaf on canvas. The portrait shows Adele Bloch-Bauer sitting on a golden throne or chair, in front of a golden starry background. Around her neck is the same jewelled choker Klimt included in the Judith painting. She wears a tight golden dress in a triangular shape, made up of rectilinear forms. In places the dress merges into the background so much so that the museum curator Jan Thompson writes that \"one comes across the model almost by accident, so enveloped is she in the thick geometric scheme\". Peter Vergo, writing for Grove Art, considers that the painting \"marks the height of ...  gold-encrusted manner of painting\".\nAdele's hair, face, décolletage and hands are painted in oil; they make up less than a twelfth of the work and, in Whitford's opinion, convey little about the sitter's character. For Whitford the effect of the gold background is to \"remove Adele Bloch-Bauer from the earthly plane, transform the flesh and blood into an apparition from a dream of sensuality and self-indulgence\"; he, and Thomson, consider the work to look more like a religious icon than a secular portrait. O'Connor writes that the painting \"seem to embody femininity\", and thus likens it to the Mona Lisa, while for Müller and Tatzkow, the gold gives the effect that Adele appears \"melancholy and vulnerable, unapproachably aloof and yet rapt\".\nBoth the current holder of the portrait—the Neue Galerie New York—and the art historian Elana Shapira describe how the background and gown contain symbols suggestive of erotica, including triangles, eggs, shapes of eyes and almonds. Also present are decorative motifs on the theme of the letters A and B, the sitter's initials. Whitford identifies influences of the art of the Byzantine, Egypt, Mycenae and Greece, describing that \"the gold is like that in Byzantine mosaics; the eyes on the dress are Egyptian, the repeated coils and whorls Mycenaean, while other decorative devices, based on the initial letters of the sitter's name, are vaguely Greek\".\nKlimt exhibited his portrait at the 1907 Mannheim International Art Show, alongside the Portrait of Fritza Riedler (1906). Many of the critics had negative reactions to the two paintings, describing them as \"mosaic-like wall-grotesqueries\", \"bizarre\", \"absurdities\" and \"vulgarities\".\nIn 1908 the portrait was exhibited at the Kunstschau in Vienna where critical reaction was mixed. The unnamed reviewer from the Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung described the painting as \"an idol in a golden shrine\", while the critic Eduard Pötzl described the work as \"mehr Blech als Bloch\" (\"more brass than Bloch\"). According to the art historian Tobias G. Natter, some critics disapproved of the loss of the sitter's individuality, while others \"accused Klimt of endangering the autonomy of art\".\nAfter exhibition at the Kunstschau, the portrait was hung at the Bloch-Bauer's Vienna residence. In 1912 Ferdinand commissioned a second painting of his wife, in which \"the erotic charge of the likeness of 1907 has been spent\", according to Whitford. In February 1918, Klimt suffered a stroke and was hospitalised; he caught pneumonia due to the worldwide influenza epidemic and died that month.\nOn 19 January 1923 Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a will. Ferdinand's brother Gustav, a lawyer by training, helped her frame the document and was named as the executor. The will included a reference to the Klimt works owned by the couple, including the two portraits of her:\nMeine 2 Porträts und die 4 Landschaften von Gustav Klimt, bitte ich meinen Ehegatten nach seinem Tode der österr. Staats-Gallerie in Wien, die mir gehörende Wiener und Jungfer.\n(Translates from the German as: \"I ask my husband after his death to leave my two portraits and the four landscapes by Gustav Klimt to the Austrian State Gallery in Vienna.\")In February 1925 Adele died of meningitis. Shortly afterwards Gustav filed for probate; he included a document that stated that the clause in the will was precatory, i.e. a request rather than a binding testament. He added that Ferdinand had said he would honour the clause, even though he, not Adele, was the legal owner of the paintings. The works by Klimt which Ferdinand owned, including the two portraits, were moved to Adele's bedroom as a shrine to her. The painting was lent for an exhibition at the Vienna Secession in 1928 to mark the tenth anniversary of Klimt's death; in 1934 it was displayed in London as part of the Austria in London exhibition. In 1936 Ferdinand gave Schloss Kammer am Attersee III to the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere; he later acquired a further Klimt painting, the Portrait of Amalie Zuckerkandl (1917–1918). In 1937 the golden portrait of Adele was lent for display at the Paris Exposition.\nIn December 1937 Gustav's daughter–and Ferdinand's niece–Maria, married the young opera singer Fritz Altman. Ferdinand gave her Adele's jewelled choker as a wedding present. Ferdinand left Vienna for his Czechoslovakian castle in March 1938, following the Anschluss of Austria by Nazi Germany. That autumn, following the Munich Agreement, he realised he was not safe and left for Paris. In September the following year, he moved to neutral Switzerland where he lived in a hotel. In his absence the Nazi regime falsely accused him of evading taxes of 1.4 million Reichsmarks. His assets were frozen and, in May 1938, a seizure order was issued that allowed the state to dispose of his property as they felt fit. His sugar factory was confiscated and turned over to the state, and went through a process of Aryanisation as Jewish shareholders and managers were replaced. His Viennese residence became an office of Deutsche Reichsbahn, the German railway company, while his castle in Czechoslovakia was taken after the German occupation as the personal residence of the SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich.\nAs part of the process to deal with the purported tax evasion, the Nazi lawyer Friedrich Führer was appointed as the administrator of the estate. In January 1939 he convened a meeting of museum and gallery directors to inspect the works and to give an indication of which they would like to obtain. After the collection was catalogued, Adolf Hitler used the Führervorbehalt  decree to obtain part of the collection at a reduced price. Several other Nazi leaders, including Hermann Göring, the Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe, also obtained works from the collection. Göring also used the Führervorbehalt decree to obtain the jewelled choker that had been given to Maria Altmann; it was given as a gift to Emmy, his wife.\nIn December 1941 Führer transferred the paintings Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I and Apfelbaum I to the Galerie Belvedere in return for Schloss Kammer am Attersee III, which he then sold to Gustav Ucicky, an illegitimate son of Klimt. A note accompanying the paintings stated he was acting in accordance with Adele's will. To remove all reference to its Jewish subject matter, the gallery renamed the portrait with the German title Dame in Gold (translates as Lady in Gold).\nIn August 1945 Ferdinand wrote a final will that revoked all previous ones. It made no reference to the pictures, which he thought had been lost forever, but it stated that his entire estate was left to his nephew and two nieces—one of whom was Maria Altmann. Ferdinand died in Switzerland in November that year.\nIn 1946 the Austrian state issued an Annulment Act that declared all transactions motivated by Nazi discrimination were void; any Jews who wanted to remove artwork from Austria were forced to give some of their works to Austrian museums in order to obtain an export permit for others. The Bloch-Bauer family hired Dr Gustav Rinesh, a Viennese lawyer, to reclaim stolen artwork on their behalf. Using the records produced by Führer, he traced most of the works to the Galerie Belvedere, and Häuser in Unterach, to Führer's own private collection. Several works were returned to the Bloch-Bauer estate, but no Klimt paintings; to obtain the necessary export permits, the family were forced to let the Austrian state retain Häuser in Unterach am Attersee, Adele Bloch-Bauer I, Adele Bloch-Bauer II, and Apfelbaum I. They were also forced to relinquish any claims on Buchenwald and Schloss Kammer am Attersee III. The Galerie Belvedere based its claim of retention of the Klimt works on Adele's will.\nIn 1998 the Austrian government introduced the Art Restitution Act, which looked again at the question of art stolen by the Nazis. The government formed a restitution committee to report on which works should be returned; government archives were opened up to research into the provenance of works held by the government. Hubertus Czernin, the Austrian investigative journalist, undertook extensive research in the newly opened archives and published a story about the theft of art by the Nazis; with the subsequent refusal of the Austrian state to return the art or to acknowledge a theft had taken place, Czernin described the situation as \"a double crime\".\nAltmann, then living in the US, hired E. Randol Schoenberg to act on her behalf. Schoenberg was the son of a woman she had been friends with since they lived in Vienna. They filed a claim with the restitution committee for the return of six paintings: Adele Bloch-Bauer I, Adele Bloch-Bauer II, Apfelbaum I, Buchenwald, Häuser in Unterach am Attersee and Amalie Zuckerkandl. The committee turned down the request, again citing Adele's will as the reason they were retaining the works. The committee's decision recommended that 16 Klimt drawings and 19 pieces of porcelain that had been held by Ferdinand and Adele and which were still at the Galerie Belvedere should be returned, as they fell outside the request of the will.\nIn March 2000 Altmann filed a civil claim against the Austrian government for the return of the paintings. She was informed that the cost of filing (consisting of 1.2% of the amount in question, plus a filing fee), would have meant a fee of €1.75 million. To avoid the prohibitively high costs, Altmann and Schoenberg sued the Austrian government and the Galerie Belvedere in the US courts. The Austrian government filed for dismissal, with arguments based on the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (1976). The Act granted immunity to sovereign nations except under certain conditions. Schoenberg showed that three of the conditions pertinent to the case were that Altmann's property had been taken in violation of international law; the property was in the possession of the state in question, or one of its agencies; and that the property had been used on a commercial basis in the US. Over four years of litigation followed as to whether the case could be brought against a sovereign state before it was brought before the Supreme Court in Republic of Austria v. Altmann. In June 2004 the Supreme Court determined that the paintings had been stolen and that Austria was not immune from a claim from Altmann; the court made no comment on the current ownership of the paintings.\nTo avoid returning to the courts in what could have been lengthy litigation process, arbitration in Austria was agreed upon by both parties, although the Austrians had turned down such a move in 1999. Three arbitrators formed the panel, Andreas Nödl, Walter Rechberger and Peter Rummel. Schoenberg gave evidence before them in September 2005 and, in January 2006, they delivered their judgement. They stated that five of the six paintings in question should be returned to the Bloch-Bauer estate, as outlined in Ferdinand's will; only the Portrait of Amalie Zuckerkandl was to be retained by the gallery.\nAfter the panel's decision was announced, the Galerie Belvedere ran a series of advertisements that appeared in bus stops and on underground railway platforms. The posters said \"Ciao Adele\", advertising the last opportunity before the painting left the country and long queues formed around the block. Although there were calls from some Austrians for the state to purchase the five paintings, the government stated that the price would be too high to justify the expense. The paintings were exported from Austria in March 2006 and exhibited together at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from April to June that year.\nWhen Altmann was asked what she wanted to do with the paintings, she stated \"I would not want any private person to buy these paintings, ... It is very meaningful to me that they are seen by anybody who wants to see them, because that would have been the wish of my aunt.\" In June 2006 the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I was sold to Ronald Lauder for $135 million for his public art museum, at the time a record price for a painting. Eileen Kinsella, the editor of ARTnews, considered the high price was due to several factors, particularly the painting's provenance, the increasing demand for Austrian Expressionism, rising prices in the art world and \"Lauder's passion for and pursuit of this particular work\". Lauder placed the work in the Neue Galerie, the New York-based gallery he co-founded. The painting has been on display at the location since. \nMichael Kimmelman, the chief art critic for the New York Times, was critical of the sale, and wrote that \"A story about justice and redemption after the Holocaust has devolved into yet another tale of the crazy, intoxicating art market.\" Altmann said of the sale that it was not practical for her, or her relatives who were also part of the estate, to retain any of the paintings. In November 2006 the remaining four Klimt paintings were sold at Christie's auction house. Adele Bloch-Bauer II sold for $87.9 million, Apfelbaum I for $33 million, Buchenwald for $40.3 million and Häuser in Unterach am Attersee for $31 million. All went to private collections.\nThe history of the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I and the other paintings taken from the Bloch-Bauers has been recounted in three documentary films, Stealing Klimt (2007), The Rape of Europa (2007) and Adele's Wish (2008). The painting's history is described in the 2012 book The Lady in Gold: The Extraordinary Tale of Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, by the journalist Anne-Marie O'Connor. The history, as well as other stories of other stolen art, is told by Melissa Müller and Monika Tatzkow in Lost Lives, Lost Art: Jewish Collectors, Nazi Art Theft, and the Quest for Justice, published in 2010. The story of Adele Bloch-Bauer and Maria Altmann formed the basis for the 2017 novel Stolen Beauty by Laurie Lico Albanese. The portrait is featured in the memoir of Gregor Collins, The Accidental Caregiver, about his relationship with Maria Altmann, published in August 2012. The book was dramatised for the stage in January 2015. In 2015, Altmann's story was dramatised for the film Woman in Gold starring Helen Mirren as Maria and Ryan Reynolds as Schoenberg.\nAltmann died in February 2011, aged 94. Schoenberg, who had worked on a 40 per cent conditional fee throughout, received $54 million for the sale of Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I and $55 million for the sale of the remaining four paintings. After he donated over $7 million for the building of the new premises of the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust, he said that he had \"tried to do good things with the money\". He subsequently specialised in the restitution of artwork plundered by the Nazis.\n"

    "painting_info": "Le Rêve (English: The Dream) is a 1932 oil on canvas painting (130 × 97 cm) by Pablo Picasso, then 50 years old, portraying his 22-year-old mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter. It is said to have been painted in one afternoon, on 24 January 1932. It belongs to Picasso's period of distorted depictions, with its oversimplified outlines and contrasted colors resembling early cubism. The erotic content of the painting has been noted repeatedly, with critics pointing out that Picasso painted an erect penis, presumably symbolizing his own, in the upturned face of his model. On 26 March 2013, the painting was sold in a private sale for $155 million, making it one of the most expensive paintings ever sold.\nLe Rêve was purchased for $7,000 in 1941 by Victor and Sally Ganz of New York City. This purchase began their 50-year collection of works by just five artists: Picasso, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, and Eva Hesse. After the Ganzes died (Victor in 1987 and Sally in 1997), their collection, including Le Rêve, was sold at Christie's auction house on November 11, 1997, as a means of settling their inheritance tax bill. Le Rêve sold for an unexpectedly high $48.4 million, at the time the fourth most expensive painting sold (tenth when taking inflation into account). The entire collection set a record for the sale of a private collection, bringing $206.5 million. The total amount paid by the Ganzes over their lifetime of collecting these pieces was around $2 million.  \nThe buyer who purchased Le Rêve at Christie's in 1997 appears to have been the Austrian-born investment fund manager Wolfgang Flöttl, who also briefly held Van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet in possession in the late 1990s. In 2001, under financial pressure, he sold  Le Rêve to casino magnate Steve Wynn for an undisclosed sum, estimated to be about $60 million. On March 26, 2013, the New York Post reported that Steven A. Cohen of SAC Capital had bought the painting from Wynn for $155 million.\nIn 2006, the painting was the centerpiece of Wynn’s collection and he had considered naming his Wynn Las Vegas resort after it. During a period of anti-French sentiment in the United States in response to France's opposition to the United States' proposed invasion of Iraq, Wynn decided it was inadvisable to give the resort a French name. In October 2006, Wynn told a group of his friends (including the screenwriter Nora Ephron and her husband Nick Pileggi, the broadcaster Barbara Walters, the art dealer Serge Sorokko and his wife, the model Tatiana Sorokko and the lawyer David Boies and his wife, Mary) that he had agreed the day before to sell Le Rêve for $139 million to Steve Cohen. At the time, this price would have made Le Rêve the most expensive piece of art ever.  While Wynn was showing the painting to his friends, apparently about to reveal the now still officially undisclosed previous owner (see above), he put his right elbow through the canvas, puncturing the left forearm of the figure and creating a six-inch tear.\nEphron offered as an explanation that Wynn uses wild gestures while speaking and has retinitis pigmentosa, which affects his peripheral vision. Later, Wynn said that he took the event as a sign to not sell the painting.\nAfter a $90,000 repair, the painting was  re-valued at $85 million. Wynn filed a claim to recover the $54 million perceived loss from his Lloyd's of London insurers, an amount which would have covered most of the initial cost of buying the painting. When the insurers balked, Wynn sued them in January 2007.\nThe case was eventually settled out of court in March 2007. Cohen bought the painting from Wynn in 2013 for $155 million (ca. $134 million in 2006 dollars). Ignoring inflation, the price was estimated to be the highest ever paid for an artwork by a U.S. collector until Kenneth C. Griffin's ~$300 million purchase of Willem de Kooning's Interchange in September 2015.\n"

    "painting_info": "Portrait of Dr. Gachet is one of the most revered paintings by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. It depicts Dr. Paul Gachet, a homeopathic doctor and artist with whom van Gogh resided following a spell in an asylum at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. Gachet took care of Van Gogh during the final months of his life. There are two authenticated versions of the portrait, both painted in June 1890 at Auvers-sur-Oise. Both show Gachet sitting at a table and leaning his head on his right arm, but they are easily differentiated in color and style. There is also an etching.\nThe first version was acquired by the Städel in Frankfurt in 1911 and subsequently confiscated and sold by Hermann Göring. In May 1990, it was sold at auction for $82.5 million ($171.1 million today) to Ryoei Saito, making it the world's most expensive painting at that time. It then disappeared from public view and the Städel was unable to locate it in 2019. The second version was owned by Gachet and was bequeathed to France by his heirs. Despite arguments over its authenticity, it now hangs in the Musée d'Orsay, in Paris.\nIn late 1888, Van Gogh began to experience a mental breakdown, cutting off part of his ear. He stayed in hospital for a month, but was not fully healed and in April 1889 he checked himself into an asylum at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, where he remained for a year. Released in 1890, Van Gogh's brother Theo searched for a home for the artist. Upon the recommendation of Camille Pissarro, a former patient of the doctor who told Theo of Gachet's interests in working with artists, Theo sent Vincent to Gachet's second home in Auvers.\nVincent van Gogh's first impression of Gachet was unfavorable. Writing to Theo he remarked: \"I think that we must not count on Dr. Gachet at all. First of all, he is sicker than I am, I think, or shall we say just as much, so that's that. Now when one blind man leads another blind man, don't they both fall into the ditch?\" However, in a letter dated two days later to their sister Wilhelmina, he relayed, \"I have found a true friend in Dr. Gachet, something like another brother, so much do we resemble each other physically and also mentally.\"\nVan Gogh had a very prolific spell during his stay with Gachet, producing more than seventy paintings, including the portraits of Gachet.\nVan Gogh's thoughts returned several times to the painting by Eugène Delacroix of Torquato Tasso in the madhouse.  After a visit with Paul Gauguin to Montpellier to see Alfred Bruyas's collection in the Musée Fabre, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, asking if he could find a copy of the lithograph after the painting.  Three and a half months earlier, he had been thinking of the painting as an example of the sort of portraits he wanted to paint: \"But it would be more in harmony with what Eugène Delacroix attempted and brought off in his Tasso in Prison, and many other pictures, representing a real man. Ah! portraiture, portraiture with the thought, the soul of the model in it, that is what I think must come.\"\nVan Gogh wrote to his sister in 1890 about the painting:\nI've done the portrait of M. Gachet with a melancholy expression, which might well seem like a grimace to those who see it... Sad but gentle, yet clear and intelligent, that is how many portraits ought to be done... There are modern heads that may be looked at for a long time, and that may perhaps be looked back on with longing a hundred years later.The portraits of Dr. Gachet were completed just six weeks before Van Gogh shot himself and died from his wounds.\nVan Gogh painted Gachet resting his right elbow on a red table, head in hand. Two yellow books as well as the purple medicinal herb foxglove are displayed on the table. The foxglove in the painting is a plant from which digitalis is extracted for the treatment of certain heart complaints, perhaps an attribute of Gachet as a physician.\nThe doctor's \"sensitive face\", which Van Gogh wrote to Paul Gauguin carried \"the heartbroken expression of our time\", is described by Robert Wallace as the portrait's focus. Wallace described the ultramarine blue coat of Gachet, set against a background of hills painted a lighter blue, as highlighting the \"tired, pale features and transparent blue eyes that reflect the compassion and melancholy of the man.\" Van Gogh himself said this expression of melancholy \"would seem to look like a grimace to many who saw the canvas\".\nWith the Portrait of Dr. Gachet, Van Gogh sought to create a \"modern portrait\", which he wrote to his sister \"impassions me most—much, much more than all the rest of my métier.\" Elaborating on this quote, Van Gogh scholar Jan Hulsker noted \"... much later generations experience it not only as psychologically striking, but also as a very unconventional and 'modern' portrait.\" He also wrote, \"My self-portrait is done in nearly the same way but the blue is the fine blue of the Midi, and the clothes are a light lilac,\" which would refer to one of his final self-portraits painted in September the year previous.\nVan Gogh also wrote to Wilhelmina regarding the Portraits of Madame Ginoux he painted first in Arles in 1888 and again in February 1890 while at the hospital in Saint-Rémy. The second set were styled after the portrait of the same figure by Gauguin, and Van Gogh described Gachet's enthusiasm upon viewing the version painted earlier that year, which the artist had carried with him to the home in Auvers. Van Gogh subsequently carried compositional elements from this portrait to that of Dr. Gachet, including the table-top with two books and pose of the figure with head leaning on one hand.\nFirst sold in 1897 by Van Gogh's sister-in-law Johanna van Gogh-Bonger for 300 francs, the painting was subsequently bought by Paul Cassirer (1904), Kessler (1904), and Druet (1910). In 1911, the painting was acquired by the Städel (Städtische Galerie) in Frankfurt, Germany and hung there until 1933, when the painting was put in a hidden room. The Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda confiscated the work in 1937 as part of its campaign to rid Germany of so-called degenerate art. Hermann Göring, through his agent Sepp Angerer, sold it to Franz Koenigs in Paris, together with The Quarry of Bibemus by Cézanne and Daubigny's Garden, also by van Gogh. In August 1939, Koenigs transported the paintings from Paris to Knoedler's in New York. Siegfried Kramarsky fled to Lisbon in November 1939 and arrived January 1940 in New York. The paintings ended up in Kramarsky's custody, where the work was often lent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nKramarsky's family put the painting up for auction at Christie's New York on May 15, 1990, where it became famous for Ryoei Saito, honorary chairman of Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Co., paying US$82.5 million for it ($75 million, plus a 10 percent buyer's commission), making it then the world's most expensive painting. Two days later Saito bought Renoir's Bal du moulin de la Galette for nearly as much: $78.1 million at Sotheby's. The 75-year-old Japanese businessman commented that he would have the Van Gogh painting cremated with him after his death. Though he later said he would consider giving the painting to the Japanese government or a museum, no information has been made public about the exact location and ownership of the portrait since his death in 1996. Reports in 2007 said the painting was sold a decade earlier to the Austrian-born investment fund manager Wolfgang Flöttl. Flöttl, in turn, had reportedly been forced by financial reversals to sell the painting to parties as yet unknown. The Städel hired a private investigator to locate the painting, hoping to show it in an exhibition in 2019. It could not be found and instead the original frame still owned by the museum was put on display empty.\nThere is a second version of the portrait which was owned by Gachet himself. In the early 1950s, along with the remainder of his personal collection of Post-Impressionist paintings, it was bequeathed to the Republic of France by his heirs.\nThe authenticity of the second version has often come under scrutiny due to a number of factors. In a letter dated 3 June 1890 to Theo, Vincent mentions his work on the portrait, which includes \"... a yellow book and a foxglove plant with purple flowers.\" The subsequent letter sent to Wilhelmina also mentions \"yellow novels and a foxglove flower.\" As the yellow novels are absent from the second version of the painting, the letters clearly reference only the original version. Dr. Gachet, as well as his son, also named Paul, were amateur artists themselves. Along with original works, they often made copies of the Post-Impressionist paintings in the elder Gachet's collection, which included not only works by Van Gogh, but Cézanne, Monet, Renoir and others. These copies were self-declared, and signed under the pseudonyms Paul and Louis Van Ryssel, yet the practice has thrown the entire Gachet collection into question, including the doctor's portrait. Additionally, some critics have noted the sheer number of works to emerge from Van Gogh's stay in Auvers, roughly eighty in seventy days, and questioned whether he painted them all himself.\nPartly in response to these accusations, the Musée d'Orsay, which holds the second version of the Gachet portrait as well as the other works originally owned by the doctor, held an exhibit in 1999 of his former collection. In addition to the paintings by Van Gogh and the other Post-Impressionist masters, the exhibition was accompanied by works of the elder and younger Gachet. Prior to the exhibition, the museum commissioned infrared, ultraviolet and chemical analysis of eight works each by Van Gogh, Cézanne, and the Gachets for comparison. The studies showed pigments on the Van Gogh paintings faded differently from the Gachet copies. It also emerged that the Gachet paintings were drawn with outlines and filled with paint, whereas the Van Gogh and Cézanne works were painted directly to canvas. Van Gogh also used the same rough canvas for all his paintings at Auvers, with the exception of The Church at Auvers (whose authenticity has never been questioned).\nIn addition to scientific evidence, defenders say that while the second version of the Portrait of Dr. Gachet is often considered to be of lesser quality than many of Van Gogh's works in Arles, it is superior in technique to anything painted by either the elder or younger Gachet.\nDutch scholar J. B. de la Faille, who compiled the first exhaustive catalog of Van Gogh works in 1928, noted in his manuscript, \"We consider this painting a very weak replica of the preceding one, missing the piercing look\" of the original. Editors of the posthumous 1970 edition of Faille's book disagreed with his assessment, stating they considered both works to be of high quality.\nVan Gogh, introduced to etching by Gachet, made the etching Portrait of Doctor Gachet in 1890.  Gachet and Van Gogh discussed creating a series of southern France themes but that never happened. This was the one and only etching, also known as L'homme à la pipe (Man with a pipe), that Van Gogh ever made. Van Gogh's brother, Theo, who received an impression of the etching, called it \"a true painter's etching. No refinement in the execution, but a drawing on metal.\" It is a different pose than that in Van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet, owned by Musée d'Orsay. The National Gallery of Canada finds that \"The undulating flow of the line is typical of the expressive quality of Van Gogh's late style.\" The impression owned by the National Gallery is from one of the 60 printings following Van Gogh's death by Dr. Gachet's son, Paul Gachet Jr. Gachet's collector's stamp appears on the bottom edge of the print.\n"

Bloch-Bauer (1881–1925) was a Vienna socialite, who was a patron and close friend of Klimt. \nIn 1907, Klimt completed an earlier portrait of Bloch-Bauer. During World War II, both portraits were among the artworks stolen by the Nazis from the descendants of Bloch-Bauer. After the war, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II was displayed at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere until 2006, when it was returned to Adele Bloch-Bauer's niece.\nAdele Bloch-Bauer was the wife of Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, a wealthy industrialist who sponsored the arts and supported Gustav Klimt. Adele Bloch-Bauer was the only person whose portrait was painted twice by Klimt; she also appeared in the much more famous Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I. Adele's portraits had hung in the family home prior to their seizure by the Nazis during World War II. The Austrian museum where they resided after the war was reluctant to return them to their rightful owners, hence a protracted court battle in the United States and in Austria (see Republic of Austria v. Altmann) ensued, which resulted in the two Adele Bloch-Bauer portraits and three other Gustav Klimt paintings being returned to Maria Altmann, the niece of Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, in January 2006.\nIn November 2006, Christie's auction house sold Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II at auction for almost $88 million, the fourth-highest priced piece of art at auction at the time. The buyer was Oprah Winfrey.\nIn the fall of 2014, Adele Bloch-Bauer II was given as a special long-term loan to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. During the summer of 2016, Oprah Winfrey sold it to an unidentified Chinese buyer for $150 million. The painting was temporarily lent to Neue Galerie New York for the exhibition “Klimt and the Women of Vienna’s Golden Age, 1900–1918.” \n"

    "short_description": "Oil-on-canvas triptych by Francis Bacon",
    "painting_info": "\n\nThree Studies of Lucian Freud is a 1969 oil-on-canvas triptych by the Irish-born British painter Francis Bacon, depicting artist Lucian Freud. It was sold in November 2013 for US$142.4 million, which at the time was the highest price attained at auction for a work of art when not factoring in inflation. That record was surpassed in May 2015 by Version O of Picasso's Les Femmes d'Alger series.\nBacon and Freud and Leila were all friends but artistic rivals. Introduced in 1945 by artist Graham Sutherland, they swiftly became close friends who met frequently. The two artists painted each other several times, starting in 1951, when Freud first sat for Bacon. Two full-length triptychs of Freud by Bacon resulted. Three Studies of Lucian Freud is the later of the two; the first one, created in 1966, has not been seen since 1992. They form part of a series of large triptych portraits of Bacon's friends painted in the 1960s; other subjects include Isabel Rawsthorne, Muriel Belcher and his (Bacon's) partner George Dyer. Bacon and Freud's friendship ended after an argument in the mid-1970s.\nAll three panels, in Bacon's typical abstract, distorted, isolated style, show Freud sitting on a cane-bottomed wooden chair within a cage, on a curved mottled-brown surface with a solid orange background. Behind each figure is a headboard of a bed, originating in a set of photographs of Freud by John Deakin which Bacon used as a reference. Michael Peppiatt writes \"Trapped here in a series of Baconian cages, a contorted Freud hovers from panel to panel like a coiled spring about to shoot out of the flat, airless picture plane.\" The central panel portrays the figure face on, in a pose similar to that Bacon used for George Dyer, his lover. Brett Gorvy of Christie's considers the work to represent \"a marriage of the incredibly important people in Bacon's life.\" The three canvases of the triptych are the same size and are each individually framed. The colouring is brighter than is typical of Bacon's works.\nFrancis Outred of Christie's describes the 1969 triptych as \"a true masterpiece\" and \"an undeniable icon of 20th Century art\" which \"marks Bacon and Freud's relationship, paying tribute to the creative and emotional kinship between the two artists.\" Art historian Ben Street describes the work as \"not an A-grade Bacon.\" It was among Bacon's favourites of his works.\nThe triptych was painted in 1969 at the Royal College of Art in London, where Bacon had a large enough studio to work on three adjacent canvases simultaneously. It was first exhibited in 1970 at the Galleria d'Arte Galatea in Turin, and then was included in a retrospective at the Grand Palais in Paris and the Kunsthalle Düsseldorf in 1971–72. The three panels of the triptych were sold separately in the mid-1970s. Bacon was unhappy that the panels had been split up, writing on a photograph of the left-hand panel that it was \"meaningless unless it is united with the other two panels.\" The panels were held by different collectors until the late 1980s, when one of the original purchasers, a collector from Rome named in some sources as Francesco De Simone Niquesa, reassembled the work. The reassembled triptych was exhibited in the US, at the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut, in 1999, but the entire work was not exhibited in the UK until October 2013.\nOn 12 November 2013, the triptych sold for US$142.4 million (including the buyer's premium) to Elaine Wynn at Christie's New York auction house, nominally becoming the most expensive work of art ever to be sold at auction. When inflation is taken into account, a higher price was reached at the same auction house for Van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet, which in 1990 sold for $171 million current dollars. Bacon's triptych did surpass the constant dollar record of $119.9 million set by the fourth version of Edvard Munch's The Scream in May 2012. The 2013 sale also represents the highest price paid for a work by a British or Irish artist, beating Bacon's Triptych 1976, which fetched $86.3 million in May 2008.\n"

    "painting_info": "Bal du moulin de la Galette (commonly known as Dance at Le moulin de la Galette) is an 1876 painting by French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir. It is housed at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and is one of Impressionism's most celebrated masterpieces. The painting depicts a typical Sunday afternoon at the original Moulin de la Galette in the district of Montmartre in Paris. In the late 19th century, working class Parisians would dress up and spend time there dancing, drinking, and eating galettes into the evening.: 121–3 \nLike other works of Renoir's early maturity, Bal du moulin de la Galette is a typically Impressionist snapshot of real life. It shows a richness of form, a fluidity of brush stroke, and a flickering, sun-dappled light.\nFrom 1879 to 1894 the painting was in the collection of the French painter Gustave Caillebotte; when he died it became the property of the French Republic as payment for death duties. From 1896 to 1929 the painting hung in the Musée du Luxembourg in Paris. From 1929 it hung in the Musée du Louvre until it was transferred to the Musée d'Orsay in 1986.\nRenoir painted a smaller version of the picture (78 × 114 cm) with the same title. The painting is now believed to be in a private collection in Switzerland. Apart from their size, the two paintings are virtually identical, although the smaller is painted in a more fluid manner than the d'Orsay version. One is presumably a copy of the original, but it is not known which is the original. It is not even known which was the one first exhibited at the 3rd Impressionist exhibition of 1877, because although the painting was catalogued and given favourable attention by critics, its entry did  not indicate the size of the painting, information that would serve to identify it.\nFor many years it was owned by John Hay Whitney. On May 17, 1990, his widow sold the painting for US$78 million at Sotheby's in New York City to Ryoei Saito (Saitō Ryōei), the honorary chairman of Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Company, Japan.\nAt the time of sale, it was one of the top two most expensive artworks ever sold, together with van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet, which was also purchased by Saito. Saito caused international outrage when he suggested in 1991 that he intended to cremate both paintings with him when he died. However, when Saito and his companies ran into severe financial difficulties, bankers who held the painting as collateral for loans arranged a confidential sale through Sotheby's to an undisclosed buyer. Although not known for certain, the painting is believed to be in the hands of a Swiss collector.\nRenoir conceived his project of painting the dancing at Le Moulin de la Galette in May 1876 and its execution is described in full by his civil servant friend Georges Rivière in his memoir Renoir et ses amis. In the first place, Renoir needed to set up a studio near the mill. A suitable studio was found at an abandoned cottage in the rue Cortot with a garden described by Rivière as a \"beautiful abandoned park\".: 130  Several of Renoir's major works were painted in this garden at this time, including La balançoire (The Swing). The gardens  and its buildings have been preserved as the Musée de Montmartre.\nRivière identified several of the personalities in the painting. Despite Renoir's resource of distributing a sought after fashionable hat of the time amongst his models (the straw bonnet with a wide red ribbon top right is an example of this hat, called a timbale), he was unable to persuade his favourite sixteen-year-old model Jeanne Samary, who appears in La balançoire, to pose  as principal for the painting (in fact she was conducting an affair with a local boy at the time). It is her sister Estelle who poses as the girl wearing a blue and pink striped dress. These two girls came to Le Moulin every Sunday with their family; with two younger sisters barely taller than the tables, and their mother and father, properly chaperoned by their mother (entry was free for girls at Le Moulin and not all were models of virtue). Beside her is a group consisting of Pierre-Franc Lamy and Norbert Goeneutte (also appearing in La balançoire), fellow painters, as well as Rivière himself. Behind her, amongst the dancers, are to be found Henri Gervex, Eugène Pierre Lestringuez and Paul Lhote (who appears in Dance in the Country). In the middle distance, in the middle of the dance hall, the Cuban painter Don Pedro Vidal de Solares y Cardenas is depicted in striped trousers dancing with the model called Margot (Marguerite Legrand). Apparently the exuberant Margot found Solares too reserved and was endeavouring to loosen him up by dancing polkas with him and teaching him dubious songs in the local slang. She was to die of typhoid just two years later, Renoir nursing her until the end, paying both for her treatment and her funeral.: 136–7 \nRivière describes the painting as executed on the spot and that not without difficulty as the wind constantly threatened to blow the canvas away. This has led some critics to speculate that it was the larger d'Orsay painting that was painted here, as the smaller would have been easier to control. On the other hand, the smaller is much the more spontaneous and freely worked of the two, characteristic of en plein air work.\n"

    "short_description": "Painting by Pablo Picasso",
    "painting_info": "Garçon à la Pipe (English: Boy with a Pipe) is an oil on canvas painting by Pablo Picasso. It was painted in 1905 when Picasso was 24 years old, during his Rose Period, soon after he settled in the Montmartre area of Paris. The painting depicts a Parisian adolescent boy who holds a pipe in his left hand and wears a garland of flowers on his head, surrounded by two floral decorations. The subject was a local boy named \"P’tit Louis\" who died at a young age. The painting is listed as one of the most expensive paintings, after being sold at Sotheby's auction for $104 million on 5 May 2004. It is currently the fifth highest selling painting by Picasso.\nIn 1905, Picasso was still a struggling artist and had settled in Montmartre in Paris. He was living in poverty in a dilapidated artist building at 13 rue Ravignan known as Le Bateau-Lavoir. Picasso had made the transition from his earlier pessimistic Blue Period and was now in a new, more optimistic phase known as his Rose Period.  \nGarçon à la Pipe depicts a teenage boy who is in a seated position surrounded by two bouquets of flowers. He is dressed in blue overalls and wears a garland of roses on his head. He holds a pipe in his left hand the wrong way round. André Salmon, a friend of Picasso, described in 1912 how Picasso had created the painting, \"after a delightful series of metaphysical acrobats, dancers like priestesses of Diana, delightful clowns and wistful Harlequins\". In place of this, Picasso was now focusing on a simple image of a young Parisian boy, dressed in blue denim.\nThe boy depicted in this painting was known as \"P’tit Louis\", or \"Little Louis\". He was described by Picasso as, \"one of the “local types, actors, ladies, gentlemen, delinquents” who frequented the studios in the Bateau-Lavoir. The harsh life of a street boy resulted in the subject dying at a young age.\nPreliminary studies for this painting show the boy in a variety of different poses, including standing, sitting, leaning against a wall, lighting a pipe or holding it in his hands. Picasso eventually chose to depict his model in the seated position shown in the finished painting, which he painstakingly worked on in a preparatory study. The studies differ from the final painting by changing the subject from a young boy to a more mature adolescent. The final effect is a depiction of a mysterious figure surrounded by masses of flowers that is reminiscent of Odilon Redon's work.\nAndré Salmon described how Picasso had transformed what was originally a study from life to the current artwork in a sudden flash of inspiration. One night, Picasso abandoned the company of his friends and their intellectual chit-chat. He returned to his studio, took the canvas he had abandoned a month before and crowned the figure of the little apprentice lad with roses. He had made this work a masterpiece thanks to a sublime whim.Picasso's rendering of \"P'tit Louis\" has elements of classical art. He was particularly inspired by the work of the French Neoclassical painter Ingres. Like Picasso's Young Girl with a Flower Basket, which was painted in the same year, Garçon à la Pipe conveys conflicting imagery of innocence and experience. Picasso described the boy as an \"evil angel\". In this painting, the boy wears a garland of roses on his head to symbolise the blood of the Eucharist, a reference to the transition from youth to maturity. Picasso also depicts the contrast between the harsh street life that Louis endured and the innocence of his youth.\nThe peculiar position of the pipe in the boy's hand has been the subject of interpretation. As the pipe was commonly used as a symbol of intellectual reflection in nineteenth- and twentieth-century painting, the pipe's position gains particular significance. The pipe appears as though being held from outside the painting, rather than from inside, thus suggesting a fusion of realities, where the boy is a reflection of Picasso himself.\nJohn Richardson suggested that the painting could have been inspired by a poem entitled A Crime of Love by Paul Verlaine. One of the most poetic Rose period images is the Boy with a Pipe. It conjures up Verlaine’s poem ‘Crimen Amoris,’ about a palace in Ecbatana where ‘adolescent satans’ neglect the five senses for the seven deadly sins, except for the most handsome of all these evil angels, who is sixteen years old under his wreath of flowers… and who dreams away, his eyes full of fire and tears.Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy probably acquired the painting c.1910. Shortly before his death in 1935, he wrote a will bequeathing it to his non-Jewish wife, Countess Else Mendelssohn-Bartholdy Kesselstett (née Lavergne-Paguilhen) who sold it to Walter Feilchenfeldt in 1949. Mr. and Mrs. John Hay Whitney then acquired the painting on 13 January 1950 for $30,000.\nIn 2004, Professor Julius H Schoeps challenged the 1949 sale of Boy with a Pipe due to circumstances related to the Nazi persecution of the Jewish owner and his attempts to shield the painting from seizure via his non-Jewish wife.\nOn 5 May 2004 the painting was sold for $104,168,000 at Sotheby's auction in New York City. Sotheby’s did not name the buyer though sources say that it was Guido Barilla, co-owner of the Barilla Group. At the time, it broke the record for the amount paid for an auctioned painting (when inflation is ignored). The amount, $104 million, includes the auction price of $93 million plus the auction house’s commission of about $11 million.  The painting was given a pre-sale estimate of $70 million by the auction house.\n\nIn 2004, Charles Moffet, co-director of Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby's remarked on the painting's significance as a masterpiece.It has a haunting ambiguity that has ensured its status as one of Picasso's most celebrated images of adolescent beauty. It is, without question, one of the most beautiful of the artist's Rose Period paintings and one of the most important early works by Pablo Picasso.Garçon à la Pipe has been described as a masterpiece, yet its sale at auction in 2004 for the price of $104 million caused some controversy amongst art critics. Picasso expert Pepe Karmel described the work as a \"minor painting\" and considered that its high sale price showed, \"how much the marketplace is divorced from the true values of art\". Blake Gopnik for The Washington Times opined that, \"Though the word \"masterpiece\" was much bandied about in the buildup to the auction, it's unlikely there's a single art historian who would rate this Rose Period picture.\"\nIn contrast, The New York Sun remarked that, \"'Boy with a Pipe' is a thrilling painting whose beauty would take a lifetime to exhaust\".\nCalvin Harris' 2017 song \"Slide\" contains the lyrics \"I might empty my bank account and buy that boy with a pipe\". Vocalist Frank Ocean explained that it is an allusion to, “a Picasso painting that sold for so much money\".\n"

    "short_description": "Painting by Georges Seurat",
    "painting_info": "Models, also known as The Three Models and Les Poseuses, is a work by Georges Seurat, painted between 1886 and 1888 and held by the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia. Models was exhibited at the fourth Salon des Indépendants in spring of 1888.\nThe piece, the third of Seurat's six major works, is a response to critics who deemed Seurat's technique inferior for being cold and unable to represent life. As a response, the artist offered a nude depiction of the same model in three different poses. In the left background is part of Seurat's 1884-1886 painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.\nModels is considered distinctive because of its pointillist technique and the political implications of its depiction of the nude female body.\nGeorges-Pierre Seurat was the third child of Ernestine Faivre and Antoine-Chrysostome Seurat. He was born in Paris on 2 December 1859 into a bourgeois family. He entered in the École des Beaux-Arts in 1878. He then studied under Henri Lehman. He, along with artists such as Paul Signac, Albert Dubois-Pilllet, and Odilon Redon were responsible for the Salon des Indépendents, which they established as an alternative to the state-sponsored Salon exhibitions.\nSeurat is best-known for A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, 1884, which was displayed in 1886 at the final Impressionist exhibition and subsequently exhibited at the Salon des Indépendents. The painting is known to be the start of Neo-Impressionist movement. Seurat is also praised for his technique of pointillism which in an almost scientific manner breaks the paint surface into dots of color that blend together when seen from afar.  \nModels is a notable example of Pointillism, which refers to painting through a series of colored dots that together make up an image.\nIn an article written by Norma Broude in the Art Bulletin, she compares Pointillism to photo printing in the 1880s France. Though not the same, there are large similarities in the results given the preoccupation with color theory and the meticulously planning of paint application in pointillism. In his works, Seurat adopted the approach to replicate the luminosity and tones found in nature. Seurat's faith in color science, use of bright colors, and mechanical brush strokes are characteristic of Neo-Impressionism.\nSeurat painted two versions of Les Poseuses. The smaller of the two is more in accord with the divisionism technique that Seurat had invented, and favoured by Seurat specialists. This version is on the cover of the catalogue for the 1991 Seurat exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Though the painting once belonged to the merchant Heinz Berggruen, it went on to become part of the  Paul Allen collection and then his estate. In 1947, at the sale of the collection of Félix Fénéon, an early advocate and promoter of Seurat, France acquired studies for the painting that now reside in the Musée d'Orsay. In November of 2022, Christies auction house sold the painting as part of the Paul G. Allen collection auction for $149.2m (£131m), including fees. \nPainted between 1886 and 1888, Les Poseuses was Seurat’s response to criticism of his painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. Critics at the time had claimed that the painting did not depict figures with sufficient realism. Les Poseuses has sometimes been interpreted as a response to this criticism, and the inclusion of A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte in the composition serves to connect the works. The incorporation of the earlier canvas within the picture also serves to make clear that the models are seen in the setting of the studio.\nLes Poseuses roughly translate as \"the posers,\" and the typical English translation of the title as \"Models\" obscures some of its original meaning. The title establishes a contrast with the subject of the painting, in which models appear to be off duty, not in the process of posing. Seurat painted the figures without idealizing them. By showing the banal realities of their work as models, he heightens the sense of their realness. They are not models in the sense of muses, but they are women who are earning money. Scholars have suggested that this approach complicates the traditional way that women have been objectified in painting. \nThe large size of the painting also challenged long-standing art historical traditions. In academic painting, larger canvases were typically reserved for history paintings, which aimed to depict mythological, religious, or historical scenes and events. Genre paintings, which tended to represent scenes of daily life, were usually smaller in scale. Seurat enlarged a banal and casual scene to the dimensions of a history painting, thereby subverting the traditional hierarchy.\nThe women's poses may also allude to earlier and widely-recognized paintings, such as Édouard Manet's 1863 Luncheon on the Grass or Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres's 1808 The Valpinçon Bather.\nFurthermore, the English art critic Waldemar Januszczak believes this painting breaks the fourth wall, offering a glimpse into the poser who is the original source of the women depicted in A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grand Jatte.\nPoseuse de dos(study)\nPoseuse debout, de face (study)\nStudy after \"The Models\", 1888\nPoseuse de face(study)\nPoseuse de profil(study)\n"

    "short_description": "1893 painting by Edvard Munch",
    "painting_info": "\nThe Scream is a composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893. The agonized face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images of art, seen as symbolizing the anxiety of the human condition. Munch's work, including The Scream, would go on to have a formative influence on the Expressionist movement.\nMunch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sun's light turned the clouds \"a blood red\". He sensed an \"infinite scream passing through nature\". Scholars have located the spot to a fjord overlooking Oslo and have suggested other explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction by Munch to his sister's commitment at a nearby lunatic asylum.\nMunch created two versions in paint and two in pastels, as well as a lithograph stone from which several prints survive. Both painted versions have been stolen, but since recovered. One of the pastel versions commanded the fourth highest nominal price paid for an artwork at a public auction. The Norwegian title is Skrik (Shriek), and the German title was Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature).\nIn his diary in an entry headed \"Nice 22 January 1892\", Munch wrote:\nOne evening I was walking along a path, the city was on one side and the fjord below. I felt tired and ill. I stopped and looked out over the fjord – the sun was setting, and the clouds turning blood red. I sensed a scream passing through nature; it seemed to me that I heard the scream. I painted this picture, painted the clouds as actual blood. The color shrieked. This became The Scream.He later described his inspiration for the image:\nI was walking along the road with two friends – the sun was setting – suddenly the sky turned blood red – I paused, feeling exhausted, and leaned on the fence – there was blood and tongues of fire above the blue-black fjord and the city – my friends walked on, and I stood there trembling with anxiety – and I sensed an infinite scream passing through nature.Among theories advanced to account for the reddish sky in the background is the artist's memory of the effects of the powerful volcanic eruption of Krakatoa, which deeply tinted sunset skies red in parts of the Western hemisphere for months during 1883 and 1884, about a decade before Munch painted The Scream. This explanation has been disputed by scholars, who note that Munch was an expressive painter and was not primarily interested in literal renderings of what he had seen. Another explanation for the red skies is that they are due to the appearance of nacreous clouds which occur at the latitude of Norway and which look remarkably similar to the skies depicted in The Scream. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the proximity of both a slaughterhouse and a lunatic asylum to the site depicted in the painting may have offered some inspiration. The scene was identified as being the view from a road overlooking Oslo, by the Oslofjord and Hovedøya, from the hill of Ekeberg. At the time of painting the work, Munch's manic depressive sister Laura Catherine was a patient at the mental asylum at the foot of Ekeberg.\nIn 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum suggested that the strange, skeletal creature in the foreground of the painting was inspired by a Peruvian mummy, which Munch could have seen at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. This mummy, which was buried in a fetal position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Paul Gauguin: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin's paintings, among those the central figure in his painting Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles) and for the old woman at the left in his painting Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?. In 2004, an Italian anthropologist speculated that Munch might have seen a mummy in Florence's Museum of Natural History, which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting. However, later studies have disputed the Italian theory, as Munch did not visit Florence until after painting The Scream.\nThe imagery of The Scream has been compared to that which an individual suffering from depersonalization disorder experiences, a feeling of distortion of the environment and one's self.\nArthur Lubow has described The Scream as \"an icon of modern art, a Mona Lisa for our time.\" It has been widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern humanity.\nMunch created four versions, two in paint and two in pastels. The first painted version was the first exhibited, debuting in 1893. It is in the collection of the National Gallery of Norway in Oslo. This is the version that has the barely visible pencil inscription \"Kan kun være malet af en gal Mand!\" (\"could only have been painted by a madman\"). A pastel version from that year, which may have been a preliminary study, is in the collection of the Munch Museum, also in Oslo. The second pastel version, from 1895, was owned by the German Jewish art collector Hugo Simon who sold it to Norwegian ship owner Thomas Olsen \"around 1937\".  It was sold for $119,922,600 at Sotheby's Impressionist and Modern Art auction on 2 May 2012 to financier Leon Black. The auction was contested by the heirs of Hugo Simon. The second painted version dates from 1910, during a period when Munch revisited some of his prior compositions. It is also in the collection of the Munch Museum. These versions have seldom traveled, though the 1895 pastel was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York from October 2012 to April 2013, and the 1893 pastel was exhibited at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam in 2015.\nAdditionally, Munch created a lithograph stone of the composition in 1895 from which several prints produced by Munch survive. Only approximately four dozen prints were made before the original stone was resurfaced by the printer in Munch's absence.\nThe material composition of the 1893 painted version was examined in 2010. The pigment analysis revealed the use of cadmium yellow, vermilion, ultramarine and viridian, among other pigments in use in the 19th century.\nThe version held by the National Museum of Norway has a pencil inscription, in small lettering, in the upper left corner, saying \"Kan kun være malet af en gal Mand!\" (\"could only have been painted by a madman\"). It can only be seen on close examination of the painting. This had been presumed to be a comment by a critic or a visitor to an exhibition. It was first noticed when the painting was exhibited in Copenhagen in 1904, eleven years after this version was painted. Following infrared photography, study of the handwriting now shows that the comment was added by Munch. The theory has been put forward that Munch added the inscription after the critical comments made when the painting was first exhibited in Norway in October 1895. There is good evidence that Munch was deeply hurt by that criticism, being sensitive to the mental illness that was prevalent in his family.\nThe Scream has been the target of a number of thefts and theft attempts. Some damage has been suffered in these thefts.\nOn 12 February 1994, the same day as the opening of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, two men broke into the National Gallery, Oslo, and stole its version of The Scream, leaving a note reading \"Thanks for the poor security\". The painting had been moved down to a second-story gallery as part of the Olympic festivities. After the gallery refused to pay a ransom demand of US$1 million in March 1994, Norwegian police set up a sting operation with assistance from the British police (SO10) and the Getty Museum and the painting was recovered undamaged on 7 May 1994. In January 1996, four men were convicted in connection with the theft, including Pål Enger , who had been convicted of stealing Munch's Vampire in 1988. They were released on appeal on legal grounds: the British agents involved in the sting operation had entered Norway under false identities.\nThe 1910 version of The Scream was stolen on 22 August 2004, during daylight hours, when masked gunmen entered the Munch Museum in Oslo and stole it and Munch's Madonna. A bystander photographed the robbers as they escaped to their car with the artwork. On 8 April 2005, Norwegian police arrested a suspect in connection with the theft, but the paintings remained missing and it was rumored that they had been burned by the thieves to destroy evidence. On 1 June 2005, with four suspects already in custody in connection with the crime, the city government of Oslo offered a reward of 2 million Norwegian krone (roughly US$313,500 or €231,200) for information that could help locate the paintings. Although the paintings remained missing, six men went on trial in early 2006, variously charged with either helping to plan or participating in the robbery. Three of the men were convicted and sentenced to between four and eight years in prison in May 2006, and two of the convicted, Bjørn Hoen and Petter Tharaldsen, were also ordered to pay compensation of 750 million kroner (roughly US$117.6 million or €86.7 million) to the City of Oslo. The Munch Museum was closed for ten months for a security overhaul.\nOn 31 August 2006, Norwegian police announced that a police operation had recovered both The Scream and Madonna, but did not reveal detailed circumstances of the recovery. The paintings were said to be in a better-than-expected condition. \"We are 100 percent certain they are the originals,\" police chief Iver Stensrud told a news conference. \"The damage was much less than feared.\" Munch Museum director Ingebjørg Ydstie confirmed the condition of the paintings, saying it was much better than expected and that the damage could be repaired. The Scream had moisture damage on the lower left corner, while Madonna suffered several tears on the right side of the painting as well as two holes in Madonna's arm. Before repairs and restoration began, the paintings were put on public display by the Munch Museum beginning 27 September 2006. During the five-day exhibition, 5,500 people viewed the damaged paintings. The conserved works went back on display on 23 May 2008, when the exhibition \"Scream and Madonna – Revisited\" at the Munch Museum in Oslo displayed the paintings together. Some damage to The Scream may prove impossible to repair, but the overall integrity of the work has not been compromised.\nIn 2008 Idemitsu Petroleum Norge AS committed an endowment of 4 million Norwegian krone towards the conservation, research and presentation of The Scream and Madonna.\nThe 1895 pastel-on-board version of the work, owned by Norwegian businessman Petter Olsen, sold at Sotheby's in London for a record price of nearly US$120 million at auction on 2 May 2012. The bidding started at $40 million and lasted for over 12 minutes when American businessman Leon Black by phone gave the final offer of US$119,922,500, including the buyer's premium. Sotheby's said the work was the most colorful and vibrant of the four versions painted by Munch and the only version whose frame was hand-painted by the artist to include his poem, detailing the work's inspiration. After the sale, Sotheby's auctioneer Tobias Meyer said the work was \"worth every penny\", adding: \"It is one of the great icons of art in the world and whoever bought it should be congratulated.\"\nThe previous record for the most expensive work of art sold at auction had been held by Picasso's Nude, Green Leaves and Bust, which went for US$106.5 million at Christie's two years prior on 4 May 2010. As of 2018, the pastel remains the fourth highest nominal price paid for a painting at auction.\nIn the late twentieth century, The Scream was imitated, parodied, and (following the expiration of its copyright) outright copied, which led to it acquiring an iconic status in popular culture. It was used on the cover of some editions of Arthur Janov's 1970 book The Primal Scream.\nIn 1983–1984, pop artist Andy Warhol made a series of silk screen prints copying works by Munch, including The Scream. His stated intention was to desacralize the painting by making it into a mass-reproducible object. Munch had already begun that process, however, by making a lithograph of the work for reproduction. Erró's ironic and irreverent treatment of Munch's masterpiece in his acrylic paintings The Second Scream (1967) and Ding Dong (1979) is considered a characteristic of post-modern art. The expression of Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) in the poster for the movie Home Alone was inspired by The Scream.\nThe Ghostface mask worn by the primary antagonists of the Scream series of horror movies is based on the painting. It was created by Brigitte Sleiertin of the Fun World costume company for the Halloween market, prior to being discovered by Marianne Maddalena and Wes Craven for the film. \nThe principal alien antagonists depicted in the 2011 BBC series of Doctor Who, named \"The Silence\", have an appearance partially based on The Scream.\nIn 2013, The Scream was one of four paintings that the Norwegian postal service chose for a series of stamps marking the 150th anniversary of Edvard Munch's birth. In 2018 Norwegian comedy duo Ylvis made a musical based on the painting's theft starring Pål Enger who stole it in 1994.\nA patient resource group for trigeminal neuralgia (which has been described as the most painful condition in existence) have also adopted the image as a symbol of the condition.\nIn most renderings, the emoji .mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace}U+1F631 😱 FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR is made to resemble the subject of the painting.\nA simplified version of the subject of the painting is one of the pictographs that was considered by the US Department of Energy for use as a non-language-specific symbol of danger in order to warn future human civilizations of the presence of radioactive waste.\nThe cover art for the MGMT album Little Dark Age possesses a figure resembling the subject of the painting, albeit in clown-like makeup.\n1893, pastel on cardboard. As possibly the earliest execution of The Scream, this appears to be the version in which Munch mapped out the essentials of the composition.\n1893, oil, tempera and pastel on cardboard. The first version publicly displayed, and perhaps the most recognizable, it is located at the National Gallery in Oslo, Norway.\n1895, lithograph print. About 45 prints were made before the printer repurposed the lithograph stone; a few were hand colored by Munch.\n1895, pastel on cardboard. It was sold for nearly US$120 million at Sotheby's in 2012, and is in the private collection of Leon Black.\n1910, tempera on cardboard. This version was stolen from the Munch Museum in 2004, but recovered in 2006.\nUndated, ink drawing. This composition, which features the central figure from The Scream is in the collection of the University Museum of Bergen.\n"

    "painting_info": "Mont Sainte-Victoire is a 1904–1906 series of oil paintings by French artist Paul Cézanne.\nMontagne Sainte-Victoire is a mountain in southern France, overlooking Aix-en-Provence. It became the subject of a number of Cézanne's paintings, in total numbering about thirty paintings and watercolors.\nMont Sainte-Victoire became one of Cézanne’s most repeated and varied themes, with Cézanne changing something about the scene each time, from his angle to the lighting to the compositional specifics to the mood he tried to evoke. Cézanne used three primary vantage points for these paintings: near his brother’s property in Bellevue, near Bibemus quarry, and in Les Lauves. His scenes generally included Mont Sainte-Victoire itself, a grey-white limestone mountain, and the surrounding valley and plains that the mountain rose from.\nCézanne’s Mont Sainte-Victoire paintings fell into two main periods: those he executed during his so-called “period of synthesis,” from roughly the 1870s to 1895, and those he created during his late period, from around 1895 until his death in 1906. Through both periods, Cézanne painted in watercolor as well as oil paints to capture Mont Sainte-Victoire with more transparency and lightness.\nOnly half a year after the opening of the Aix-Marseille train line on October 15, 1877, in a letter to Émile Zola dated April 14, 1878, Cézanne praised Mont Sainte-Victoire, which he viewed from the train while passing through the railway bridge at Arc River Valley, as a \"beau motif (beautiful motif).\" Around this time, he began a series in which he tropicalized the mountain.\nThese paintings belong to Post-Impressionism. Cézanne used geometry to describe nature and different colours to represent the depth of objects. Cézanne generally tried to convey the eternal, interior structure of the scene before him, more than the ephemeral surface features. While the Impressionists tried to depict nature directly as they saw it, Cézanne generally tried to convey a sense of what was beneath what the naked eye could see, though he still had a sharp eye for subtle changes in light and atmosphere. Cézanne tried to evoke emotions through his works and “find order in his sensations.” The whole series embodies Cézanne’s struggle to mold nature into art through geometric forms and effects of color.\nCézanne lived in Aix for most of his life. He inherited his family estate after the death of his father, and was free of financial worries for the first time in his life, making him able to focus on art, which he pursued with “extraordinary patience and self-discipline.”\nHowever, after his mother died in 1897, he was forced to sell his property outside Aix to settle her estate among him and his two sisters, Marie and Rose. The house finally sold in 1899. The loss of this house was a significant emotional blow for Cézanne. He ended up buying a property just north of Aix, on the hill Les Lauves, and built a studio in 1902. The property had a large view of Aix and the vast surrounding plains, including Mont Sainte-Victoire. This was where he completed most of his late period paintings.\nWhile Monet tried to finish landscape paintings in single sessions to capture the moment, Cézanne returned to Mont Sainte-Victoire repeatedly to accumulate a deep idea of the subject. This process resulted in literally timeless paintings, with the paintings not obviously reflecting a certain time of day, season, or even weather condition. Cézanne tried to create a clear sense of the interior structure of the landscape. He distorted the forms of Mont Sainte-Victoire subtly to create clear geometric shapes and pictorial balance.\nCézanne was finally able to exhibit a one-man show in Paris in 1895, endorsed by Ambroise Vollard. It did not attract widespread attention, but it proved influential on younger artists, and Cézanne gradually acquired a “legendary reputation.” His subsequent influence, before and after his death, has been varied but enduring.\nCézanne turned against Impressionist naturalism to create a Post-Impressionist, Symbolist aesthetic. This developed specifically in the landscape tradition. Many artists at the time were reacting against the realism of Impressionist naturalism because of its emphasis on the transient. They wanted to pursue something more concrete and structured in order to arrive at a greater sense of truth in their paintings. This sentiment led to the Symbolist tradition.\nLandscape painters in the Symbolist tradition explored how the power of color and form could evoke emotion. They were interested in ambiguity and the emotive power of color and form. Some used the creation of timeless and subjective landscapes as a form of escapism. Cézanne specifically, in these paintings, explored the relationship between surface and depth, between plane and color, drawing tension between order and emotion. For Cézanne, Mont Sainte-Victoire embodied nature’s grandeur and enduring nature. He  was convinced that each new painting of Mont Sainte-Victoire would offer some new insight into “another facet of its meaning or character,” with the mountain assuming an abstract, elusive appeal.\nThis period of paintings as a whole is crucial to understanding Cézanne’s later work. They display “powerful geometric reductiveness,” foreshadowing cubism and abstraction.\nCézanne’s work during this period was filled with direct light and sharply outlined forms. These paintings were deeply “preconceived and pondered.” He tended to compose paintings in lines or bands across his canvases. In his landscapes, including the paintings of Mont Sainte-Victoire, Cézanne liked to modify and simplify the scenes. This broke the landscape norm of composing in planes in order to define depth. Cézanne’s landscapes also tended to have asymmetrical compositions, as well as broad and thick brushstrokes, to the point that he sometimes used the palette knife.\nThe bulk of Cézanne’s Mont Sainte-Victoire paintings during this period were from the mid-1880s on. Most of these works were executed with Cézanne situated east of Aix. He was particularly drawn to Mont Sainte-Victoire for its clarity and stark geometric form. In his works, Cézanne generally strove to unify rhythm, form, and color. His works became the most detailed from 1884-1888, and became more loose and “visionary” later on.\nCézanne’s Mont Sainte-Victoire paintings during this period generally displayed an extended profile of the mountain dominating the familiar valley. In some, a railroad bed cuts across the fields, with the arched viaduct crossing the middle ground. Houses and farm buildings dot the landscape. Many features “assume the weight of its history,” like the train trestle that transforms into an ancient aqueduct, resembling a Roman road. These features, as well as careful placement of the trees, allowed more fluid and intimate access to the mountain.\nA few paintings explore the relationship between the mountain, the single pine, the viaduct, and the ridge of Le Cengle. Cézanne climbed up and down the incline to test different views of this scene and these motifs. He enjoyed the interplay of the firmer planes of the landscape and mountain and the musicality of the trees. He would use structures, like the viaduct and arches, to introduce rhythm and pattern into the landscape. This rhythm gave the paintings a sense of unity and intention that is very  different from Cézanne’s later paintings, making them more accessible than isolated. Cézanne often used a single pine as a framing device, like a curtain, which was generally placed on the left. This device was probably derived from his work with Pissarro.\nIn general, these paintings contain a relaxed gradation of greens, grays, and blues that imbue this series of paintings with more of a sense of peacefulness. They tend to be more consistent and transparent, creating atmospheric effects unique in Cézanne’s repertoire. In one painting with a single pine, the dark brown of the trunk and brighter green of the needles set up an effective contrast to the calmer background, giving the effect of “tranquil release.” In another, all the colors are more translucent, creating a sense of awe and structure sometimes aided by Chinese white paint, which had an “opalescent” quality.\nIn the painting Mont Sainte-Victoire Seen from the Bibémus Quarry, c. 1897, as an example from this period, Cézanne concentrated on the peak of the mountain, floating above the reddish rocks below it. The mountain rises above the smooth, angular quarry, the crest tying the landscape together and providing a sense of stability. Mont Sainte-Victoire acts as a counterpoint to the dynamic perspective of the foreground. The work was painted from a high vantage point, with the tops of the pine trees as visual entry points to the scene. The viewers encounter this warm green gate before the cold rocks beyond.\nIn another example of this period, Mont Sainte-Victoire seen from above the Tholonet Road, c. 1896-8, the mountain looms overhead, effectively displacing the sky. This painting similarly utilizes warm, red tones across the landscape and cool, blue tones across the mountain and sky, with the clear light exposing the dry air. This work is more reductive than his past works; the higher vantage point allows the slope of the valley leading into the mountain to lie open and the foreground to be reduced, and Mont Sainte-Victoire to stand boldly and clearly before the viewer. Pine trees anchor the composition, giving it a sense of stability. It has a vertical format, emphasizing the upwards formation of the mountain. This vertical format is only present in two of Cézanne’s other paintings of Mont Sainte-Victoire.\nAs a final example, in Cézanne’s canvas at the Musée d’Orsay, the viaduct is included, as usual, but the road was obscured, reorienting the features of the landscape. The painting emphasizes horizontal elements in the composition. In this work, Cézanne blended and undercut colors; green, ocher, and blue shades are set against shades of lavender and chartreuse yellow, brightening the painting. It has a blended and smooth quality that is less crisp and clear than his other, more architectural works. This painting also notably has a more golden hue and autumnal color than his other contemporary works, presaging his later Mont Sainte-Victoire works.\nCézanne’s Late Period ran from about 1895 until his death in 1906, but most of his works of Mont Sainte-Victoire came from the time after Cézanne bought property just north of Aix in 1902. From 1902-1906, Cézanne painted MSV eleven times in oil paint, and many more in watercolor. This period was defined by more saturated colors, less stable compositions, and a more clear division of forms into smaller parts, as dictated by Cézanne’s thick brushstrokes. He created his forms with discrete patches of intense color, developing his compositions by considering the elements of the paintings as geometric shapes imbued with color. The structure constructed from these shapes became stronger and then more implied, in order to emphasize emotional intensity. The subject matter was almost unrecognizable within the brushstrokes, pointing the way toward abstraction. Cézanne’s analytical approach to these unpopulated landscapes caused the paintings to seem distanced from humanity.\nIn the paintings Cézanne did from this period, the mountain was often shown in dramatic profile, the peak rising over the surrounding plain, which spread out in a patchwork of farm buildings, trees, and fields. They are imbued with a sense of urgency and anticipation. Cézanne emphasized the roughness of nature in these paintings by combining the stark, architectural forms of the landscape and mountain with the wild, lyrical vegetation. He did not seek to represent nature traditionally, but rather to, first and foremost, express the consistent, permanent nature of the structure beneath the surface.\nIn several of the Mont Sainte-Victoire paintings, Cézanne left parts of the canvas bare. Furthermore, he often used diluted oil paint and watercolor. He saw these as giving him greater freedom and flexibility, painting faster, lighter, and with more fluidity. The fleeting lighting and weather in which some of his paintings were made led to many of them being left unfinished. This unfinished quality of Cézanne’s works was a continuation of the Impressionists’ method of intentionally making their paintings look unfinished, or sketch-like.\nIn one painting from this period, simply entitled Mont Sainte-Victoire, and which is now in the Annenberg Collection, Cézanne constructed the painting on five different pieces of canvas that were pieced together over time. His brushstrokes cut across pieces of canvas to create one cohesive image, but the addition of these pieces “provides an explanation of  development.” This multi-canvas technique was rare for Cézanne, but was not unique among the Impressionists; Degas also used this technique, but any direct connection between the two is unlikely. Here, the mountain is clear and pristine, its contours painted with a “brilliant” blue. The western slope is constructed with minute, transparent brushwork over a white primer, and reflects the light shining over the landscape, while the northern slope is darkened in shadow. The sky is painted in even strokes of green, blue, and lavender, with patches of white interjected as passing clouds, while the valley rolls forward in layers of green and ocher towards the farmhouse, which stands firm and geometric among the surrounding, more musical trees and fields. Broader and wetter brushstrokes accompany the composition downwards, along with tighter and more constricted color modulations, while to the right of the mountain, the upright brushstrokes in the plain likewise get broader and more energetic. This conveys a sense of acceleration from left to right, to the point of the space seeming to bend as the brushstrokes get larger and the color gets thinner. The greens and blues in the right third of the sky also get more energetic and abstract and sweep off the canvas. Much of the canvas is left bare in the energy and excitement in which Cézanne produced the painting, but still, the small farmhouse is clearly defined, establishing rhythm and recession. Cézanne’s vision for the painting seems to have shifted as he worked on it, as evidenced by the additional strips of canvas and changing energy and style of brushstrokes. Throughout the painting, it is clear that Cézanne wrestled with the issue of trying to convey color while also expressing distance. The work's energy, geometric quality, and abstract look is emblematic of Cézanne’s work during this late period.\nIn general, Cézanne’s MSV series “have been discussed in the grandest terms.” They are considered to represent Cézanne’s transformation into the highest mode of his artistic ideals.\nLionello Venturi, for example, described the Mont Sainte-Victoire paintings as part of a “cosmic” creation, noting that “The structure is more and more implied, and less and less apparent.” Cézanne himself noted, according to Joachim Gasquet, that the mountain held some sort of “cosmic” significance for him: “Look at Ste.-Victoire. What élan, what an imperious thirst for the sun, and what melancholy, in the evening, when all this weightiness falls back to earth...These masses were made of fire. Fire is in them still. Both darkness and daylight seem to recoil from them in fear, trembling. There above us is Plato’s cave: see how, as large clouds pass by, the shadow that they ast shudders on the rocks, as if burned, suddenly swallowed by a mouth of fire.” Such statements capture how Cézanne imbues MSV with a sense of urgency and drama, and how he hoped his paintings would be received by viewers. Indeed, this perception has been echoed by critics like Fritz Novotny, who have argued that, in these works, Cézanne gave up real truth to nature. His MSV paintings are simultaneously “timeless” and “quiet” as well as “turbulent” and “ecstatic.”\nDespite its grand ambitions, this series has “rarely been critically assessed or published,” in the scheme of art history., although it was featured in the 1980 BBC television series 100 Great Paintings.\nIn 2012, a version of Cézanne's Montagne Sainte-Victoire (Landscape with Mont Sainte-Victoire), 1897 was discovered in the stash of paintings held by the Munich recluse Cornelius Gurlitt.  \nMont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley (1882–1885), Metropolitan Museum of Art\nMont Sainte-Victoire with Large Pine  (c. 1887), Courtauld Institute of Art\nMontagne Sainte-Victoire, 1890, Scottish National Gallery\nMont Sainte-Victoire and Château Noir, 1904–1906, Bridgestone Museum of Art\nPrinceton University Art Museum (1904-1906)\n"

    "painting_info": "Flag is an encaustic painting by the American artist Jasper Johns. Created when Johns was 24 (1954–55), two years after he was discharged from the US Army, this painting was the first of many works that Johns has said were inspired by a dream of the U.S. flag in 1954. It is arguably the painting for which Johns is best known.\nThe work measures 107.3 centimetres (42.2 in) by 153.8 centimetres (60.6 in). It is made using encaustic, oil paint, and newsprint collage on three separate canvases, mounted on a plywood board. The painting reflects the three colors of the US flag: red, white and blue; the flag is depicted in the form it took between 1912 and 1959, with 48 white stars on a blue canton representing the then-US states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), and with thirteen red and white stripes. Newsprint is visible under the stripes. Reading the texts, it is clear that the newsprint was not selected at random: Johns steered clear of headlines, or national or political news, and used inconsequential articles or adverts. The painting has a rough-textured surface, and the 48 stars are not identical. It is dated 1954 on its reverse.\nJohns made over 40 works based on the US flag, including a large and monochrome White Flag in 1955, and his 1958 work Three Flags with three superimposed flags showing a total of 84 stars.\nJasper Johns's 48-star Flag from 1958 was purchased in 2010 by hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen for an estimated $110 million, making it the most expensive painting ever by a living artist.\nIn November 2014 the encaustic Flag (1983) was auctioned off for $36,000,000 at Sotheby's New York.\n"

    "painting_info": "Nude, Green Leaves and Bust (French: Nu au Plateau de Sculpteur) is a 1932 painting  by Pablo Picasso, featuring his mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter.\nThe painting was in the personal collection of Los Angeles art collectors Sidney and Frances Brody for nearly six decades. It sold at auction for US$106.5 million, the third highest price for a piece of artwork sold at auction at the time.\nNude, Green Leaves and Bust is one of a series of portraits that Picasso painted of his mistress and muse Marie-Thérèse Walter from 1932. The vibrant blue and lilac canvas is more than 5 feet (1.5 m) tall.\nAt the time, Picasso was in an exclusive contractual relationship with noted impressionist and post-impressionist French-Jewish art dealer Paul Rosenberg, who bought the painting direct from his friend. With the increasing tones of an approaching war, in the late 1930s Rosenberg started to distribute works from his 2,000+ piece collection around the world, and used the 1939 New York World's Fair as the excuse to ship the painting outside France. After the 1940 Nazi invasion of France, on reaching New York via Lisbon in September 1940, Rosenberg opened a new branch of his noted gallery on East 57th street and put the painting back on display.\nFrom there it was bought by the Brodys in 1951, and was publicly exhibited only once in 1961, to commemorate Picasso's 80th birthday.\nFrances Brody died in November 2009. On May 4, 2010, the painting was sold at Christie's in New York City, who won the rights to auction the collection against London-based Sotheby's. The collection as a whole was valued at over US$150 million, while the work was originally expected to earn $80 million at auction.\nThere were eight bidders at the auction house, while the winning bid was taken via telephone for $95 million. Including the buyer's premium, the price reached US$106.5 million. When inflation is ignored, the painting broke the record price for an art work sold at auction until it was surpassed by the selling of The Scream on May 2, 2012 for US$120 million.\n"

    "painting_info": "The Roulin Family is a group of portrait paintings Vincent van Gogh executed in Arles in 1888 and 1889 on Joseph, his wife Augustine and their three children: Armand, Camille and Marcelle.  This series is unique in many ways.  Although Van Gogh loved to paint portraits, it was difficult for financial and other reasons for him to find models.  So, finding an entire family that agreed to sit for paintings — in fact, for several sittings each — was a bounty.\nJoseph Roulin became a particularly good, loyal and supporting friend to Van Gogh during his stay in Arles. To represent a man he truly admired was important to him. The family, with children ranging in age from four months to seventeen years, also gave him the opportunity to produce works of individuals in several different stages of life.\nRather than making photographic-like works, Van Gogh used his imagination, colours and themes artistically and creatively to evoke desired emotions from the audience.\nThis series was made during one of Van Gogh's most prolific periods.  The work allowed him to pull artistic learnings over the past several years towards the goal of expressing something meaningful as an artist.\nVan Gogh moved to Arles in southern France in 1888, where he produced some of his best work. His paintings represented different aspects of ordinary life, such as portraits of members of the Roulin family.  The sunflower paintings, some of the most recognizable of Van Gogh's paintings, were created in this time. He worked continuously to keep up with his ideas for paintings. This is likely one of Van Gogh's happier periods of life. He is confident, clear-minded and seemingly content.\nIn a letter to his brother, Theo, he wrote, \"Painting as it is now, promises to become more subtle – more like music and less like sculpture – and above all, it promises colour.\" As a means of explanation, Vincent explains that being like music means being comforting.\nVan Gogh, known for his landscapes, seemed to find painting portraits his greatest ambition.  He said of portrait studies, \"the only thing in painting that excites me to the depths of my soul, and which makes me feel the infinite more than anything else.\"  Van Gogh wrote further of the meaning he wished to evoke: \"in a picture I want to say something comforting as music is comforting. I want to paint men and women with that something of the eternal which the halo used to symbolize, and which we seek to communicate by the actual radiance and vibration of our colouring.\"\nAs much as Van Gogh liked to paint portraits of people, there were few opportunities for him to pay or arrange for models for his work.  He found a bounty in the work of the Roulin family, for which he made several images of each person. In exchange, Van Gogh gave the Roulins one painting for each family member.\nAs the Roulin family was similar in size to Van Gogh's own, in his psychological approach Lubin suggested that Van Gogh may have adopted them as a substitute.\nVan Gogh painted the family of postman Joseph Roulin in the winter of 1888, every member more than once. The family included Joseph Roulin, the postman; his wife, Augustine; and their three children.  Van Gogh described the family as \"really French, even if they look like Russians.\" Over the course of just a few weeks, he painted Augustine and the children several times. The reason for multiple works was partly so that the Roulins could have a painting of each family member, so that with these pictures and others, their bedroom became a virtual \"museum of modern art.\"  The family's consent to modeling for van Gogh also gave him the opportunity to create more portraits, which was both meaningful and inspirational to van Gogh.\nVan Gogh used color for dramatic effect. Each family member's clothes are done in bold primary colours and van Gogh used contrasting colours in the background to intensify the impact of the work.\nJoseph Roulin was born on 4 April 1841 in Lambesc.  His wife, née Augustine-Alix Pellicot, was also from Lambesc; they married 31 August 1868.  Joseph, 47 years of age at the time of these paintings, was ten years his wife's senior. Theirs was a working class household. Joseph worked at the railroad station as an entreposeur des postes.\nVan Gogh and Joseph Roulin met and became good friends and drinking companions. Van Gogh compared Roulin to Socrates on many occasions; while Roulin was not the most attractive man, van Gogh found him to be \"such a good soul and so wise and so full of feeling and so trustful.\"  Strictly by appearance, Roulin reminded van Gogh of Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky – the same broad forehead, broad nose, and shape of the beard.  Roulin saw van Gogh through the good and the most difficult times, corresponding with his brother, Theo following his rift with Gauguin and being at his side during and following the hospital stay in Arles.\nIn the very first days of December 1888 Vincent told his brother Theo:\nI have made portraits of a whole family, that of the postman whose head I had done previously – the man, his wife, the baby, the young boy, and the son of sixteen, all of them real characters and very French, though they look like Russians. Size 15 canvases. You know how I feel about this, how I feel in my element, and that it consoles me up to a certain point for not being a doctor. I hope to get on with this and to be able to get more careful posing, paid for by portraits. And if I manage to do this whole family better still, at least I shall have done something to my liking and something individual. Just now I am completely swamped with studies, studies, studies, and this will go on for quite a while – it makes such a mess that it breaks my heart, and yet it will provide me with some property when I'm forty.The size given (Toile de 15, c. 65 x 54 cm), the complete set can be identified:\nAugustine Roulin (née Augustine-Alix Pellicot) was born on 9 October 1851 in Lambesc and died on 5 April 1930.\nAfter her husband had posed for several works with van Gogh, Augustine sat for Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin in the Yellow House the two men shared. During the sitting, she kept her gaze on Gauguin, possibly for reassurance because, according to her daughter, she was not comfortable in the presence of van Gogh.  She sat in the corner of the room for the evening sitting. The resulting paintings were quite different, as was typical of the sessions where the artists shared the same model. Gauguin's portrait included as background a picture he recently completed entitled Blue Trees.  He painted Augustine in straightforward, literal way.\nIn comparison, Van Gogh's work appeared more quickly executed and more thickly painted than that of Gauguin's painting. Van Gogh admired the work of Dutch master Frans Hals whose portraits display lively brushwork and the direct, spontaneous style of alla prima, or wet-on-wet .  The yellow brushstrokes on the side of her head depict the gaslight.  Instead of depicting the evening mood, he painted pots of sprouting bulbs. Van Gogh made a connection to her earthy nature by the depiction of germinating bulbs, essentially declaring her a \"human tuber.\"  Days after working on this painting Van Gogh began painting the remaining Roulin family members, including the four-month-old baby, Marcelle.\n\nIn addition to the mother-daughter works where Marcelle is visible, Van Gogh also created several La Berceuse \nworks where Augustine rocked her unseen cradle by a string.\nVan Gogh labeled the group of work La Berceuse meaning \"our lullaby or the woman rocking the cradle.\"  The colour and setting were intended to set the scene of a lullaby, meant to give comfort to \"lonely souls.\"  Van Gogh imagined the painting in several types of settings, such as on an Icelandic fishing boat cabin walls—or the center piece to two Sunflower paintings.\n\nThere is a fifth version of the painting at the Art Institute of Chicago.\nArmand Roulin, the eldest son, was born on 5 May 1871 in Lambesc, and died on 14 November 1945.  He was 17 years of age when portrayed by Van Gogh.\nVan Gogh's works depict a serious young man who at the time the paintings were made had left his parents' home, working as a blacksmith's apprentice.  The Museum Folkwang work depicts Armand in what are likely his best clothes: an elegant fedora, vivid yellow coat, black waistcoat and tie.  Armand's manner seems a bit sad, or perhaps bored by sitting.  His figure fills the picture plane giving the impression that he is a confident, masculine young man.\nThe second work, with his body slightly turned aside and his eyes looking down, appears to be a sad young man. Even the angle of the hat seems to indicate sadness. Both museum paintings were made on large canvas, 65 x 54 cm.\nLoving Vincent, a movie based on the life of Vincent van Gogh, features Armand Roulin as the main character. In it, Roulin's asked by his father, Joseph, to deliver a letter to Vincent's brother, Theo van Gogh. The critically acclaimed film employed oil painters trained to paint like van Gogh. Their paintings were used in each frame of the movie, using stills of van Gogh's real paintings and basing Armand Roulin's character design on another of van Gogh's paintings. Many of van Gogh's portraits, like Portrait of Armand Roulin (1888), provided designs for the movie's characters.\nCamille Roulin, the middle child, was born in Lambesc in southern France, on 10 July 1877, and died on 4 June 1922. When his portrait was painted, Camille was eleven years of age.  The Van Gogh Museum painting  shows Camille's head and shoulders.  Yellow brush strokes behind him are evocative of the sun.\nA very similar painting resides at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (F537).\nIn The Schoolboy with Uniform Cap Camille seems to be staring off in space. His arm is over the back of a chair, mouth gaped open, possibly lost in thought.  This was the larger of the two works made of Camille.\nMarcelle Roulin, the youngest child (31 July 1888 – 22 February 1980) was four months old, when Van Gogh made her portraits.  She was painted three times by herself and twice on her mother’s lap.  The three works show the same head and shoulders image of Marcelle with her chubby cheeks and arms against a green background.\nWhen Johanna van Gogh, pregnant at the time, saw the painting, she wrote:  \"I like to imagine that ours will be just as strong, just as beautiful – and that his uncle will one day paint his portrait!\"  A version titled Roulin's Baby resides at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\nIn Philadelphia Museum of Art's Portrait of Madame Augustine Roulin and Baby Marcelle Augustine holds baby Marcelle who was born in July, 1888.  The mother, relaxed and her face in a shadow, is passive.  We can see by the size of Augustine's sloping shoulders, arm, and hands that she worked hard to take care of her family. For instance, there were no modern conveniences like washing machines.  In a traditional pose of mothers and new babies, Augustine is holding her baby upright, supporting the baby's back by her right arm and steadying the baby's midsection with her left hand. Marcelle, whose face is directed outward, is more active and engages the audience.  Van Gogh used heavy outlines in blue around the images of mother and baby.\nTo symbolize the closeness of mother and baby, he used adjacent colours of the colour wheel, green, blue and yellow in this work. The vibrant yellow background creates a warm glow around mother and baby, like a very large halo. Of his use of colour, Van Gogh wrote: \"instead of trying to reproduce exactly what I have before my eyes, I use colour...to express myself more forcibly.\" The work contains varying brushstrokes, some straight, some turbulent – which allow us to see the movement of energy \"like water in a rushing stream.\" Émile Bernard, Van Gogh's friend, was the initial owner of this painting in its provenance.\n"

    "painting_info": "Irises is one of several paintings of irises by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, and one of a series of paintings he made at the Saint Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France, in the last year before his death in 1890.\nVan Gogh started painting Irises within a month of entering the asylum, in May 1889, working from nature in the hospital garden. There is a lack of the high tension which is seen in his later works. He called painting \"the lightning conductor for my illness\" because he felt that he could keep himself from going insane by continuing to paint.\nThe painting was probably influenced by Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints like many of his works and those by other artists of the time. The similarities occur with strong outlines, unusual angles, including close-up views, and also flattish local color (not modeled according to the fall of light). The painting is full of softness and lightness. Irises is full of life without tragedy.\nHe considered this painting a study which is probably why there are no known drawings for it, although Theo, Van Gogh's brother, thought better of it and quickly submitted it to the annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants in September 1889, together with Starry Night Over the Rhone. He wrote to Vincent of the exhibition: \" strikes the eye from afar. The Irises are a beautiful study full of air and life.\" The painting is one of his most renowned works.\nThe first owner was Julien \"Père\" Tanguy, a paint grinder and art dealer whose portrait van Gogh painted three times. In 1892 Tanguy sold Irises to art critic and anarchist Octave Mirbeau who was also one of Van Gogh's first supporters. Mirbeau paid 300 francs for it.\nIn 1987, it became the most expensive painting ever sold, setting a record which stood for two and a half years. Then it was sold for US$53.9 million to Alan Bond, but Bond did not have enough money to pay for it. Irises was later re-sold in 1990 to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. Irises is currently (as of 2022) thirty-first on the inflation-adjusted list of most expensive paintings ever sold and in 102nd place if the effects of inflation are ignored.\n"

    "short_description": "Painting by Pablo Picasso",
    "painting_info": "\nDora Maar au Chat (English: Dora Maar with Cat) is an oil on canvas painting by Pablo Picasso. It was painted in 1941 and depicts Dora Maar, (original name Henriette Theodora Markovitch) the artist's lover, seated on a chair with a small cat perched on her shoulders. The painting is listed as one of the most expensive paintings, after achieving a price of $95 million at Sotheby's on 3 May 2006. It is currently the sixth highest selling painting by Picasso.\nThe canvas is one of many portraits of Dora Maar painted by Pablo Picasso over their nearly decade-long relationship. Their relationship began when Picasso met Maar on the set of Jean Renoir's film Le Crime de Monsieur Lange, where she was working as a movie photographer. They were formally introduced by a French Surrealist poet named Paul Éluard. Picasso fell in love with the 29-year-old Maar at the age of 55 and the couple began living together. Picasso was drawn to Maar not only for her beauty, but also for her intellect and artistic nature. Like Picasso, Maar was an artist, photographer and poet. She shared Picasso's political views and also spoke Spanish. Their relationship was intensely passionate and tempestuous and she challenged Picasso both intellectually and artistically. Maar assisted Picasso with his artwork, particularly during his creation of Guernica, which she documented with photographs.\nThis painting was made during the year 1941, at the beginning of World War II. Picasso had already painted Maar many times before creating this painting. When the Nazis occupied France, the tension between Maar and Picasso increased, resulting in Picasso portraying Maar in a much more abstract way, sometimes depicting her in tears.\nDora Maar au Chat is one of the largest portraits of the subject by Picasso. It is an oil on canvas painting measuring 128.3 cm x 95.3 cm and is signed by the artist on the lower left corner. As Picasso's mistress and main model, Dora Maar was the artist's main source of inspiration and his artistic companion. The painting was created in 1941 during the midst of their tempestuous relationship.\nThe painting is a rare, three-quarter length portrait of Maar, who is sitting in an armchair. Picasso used a vibrant palette to depict Maar's clothing and gave particular attention to detail to the angles of the chair and the pattern on the dress. Maar's hat is particularly significant, as it signifies her involvement in the Surrealist movement. Like a crown on her head, the hat is particularly ornate, embellished with colourful feathers and red trim. The presence of the subject is pronounced, reflecting the way a queen would sit on her throne.\nIn this painting, Picasso aims to depict not only Dora's beauty, but also her temperament. He once described her as an \"Afghan cat\" in reference to her personality. The presence of the cat on her shoulder offers special significance, as it reflects the traditional pairing of cats and women in art that was used to suggest female cunning and sexual aggression. This theme is particularly noticeable in the way that the artist depicted Maar's long manicured fingernails, which in Picasso's portrait have been rendered as long talons.\nPicasso depicted Maar's portrait in the Cubist style. He used faceted planes and blocks of colour to sculpt her body. The outlines of shapes in the body are accentuated in black, while Maar's face is sculpted in white. The composition is a construction of shapes with vertically inclined planes that contrast with the lines of the wooden floor in the background. Maar's face is presented from two angles, one half in profile with the eye looking straight at the viewer, and the other half of a full face. This possibly reflects Freud's writings about the double self existing in every person.\n\nDavid Norman, Chairman of Sotheby's Impressionist and Modern Art Department Worldwide, summarised the importance of the composition.Dora Maar Au Chat presents the artist’s most mysterious and challenging mistress regally posed three-quarter length in a large wooden chair with a small black cat perched behind her in both an amusing and menacing attitude. The faceted planes of her body and richly layered surface of brushstrokes impart a monumental and sculptural quality to this dazzling portrait. The painting is also remarkable for its brilliance of color and the complex and dense patterning of the model’s dress. The powerful figure is set in a dramatic, yet simple setting composed of a vertiginously inclined plane of wooden floorboards and shallow interior space that is arranged in a manner reminiscent of Picasso’s earliest manipulations of space in a Cubist manner.\nCharles Moffett, Vice Chairman of Sotheby's, remarked on the painting's significance.Dora Maar with Cat is unquestionably one of Picasso's most extraordinary portrayals of the woman who for nearly a decade was his muse, model, and lover. An accomplished photographer who was close to key members of the Surrealist circle, Maar appealed deeply to Picasso because of her arresting and wild beauty, engaging intellect, and commitment as an artist. As Brigitte Léal has observed with regard to the portraits of Dora Maar that Picasso painted in the early 1940s, ‘...they embody the height of modern beauty as  Breton envisioned it, based on the principle of vital disorder, which the figure of Dora Maar, in her extreme mutability, her real, spiritual restlessness, will forever incarnate’.Pierre Colle of Paris acquired the painting by 1946. The painting was then obtained by Chicago collectors Leigh and Mary Block by 1947. They sold the painting in 1963. After that, the painting was never seen in public until the 21st century.\nDuring 2005 and 2006, Dora Maar au Chat, then owned by the Gidwitz family of Chicago, was shown worldwide as part of Sotheby's exhibitions in London, Hong Kong and New York. It came up for sale in an auction held at Sotheby's on 3 May 2006 in New York, making it the second-highest price ever paid for a painting at auction at the time. An anonymous Russian bidder who was present at the auction won the work with a final bid of $95,216,000, well exceeding the pre-auction estimate of $50 million. The identity of the bidder, who also purchased an 1883 Monet seascape and a 1978 Chagall, was a topic of much speculation. The winning buyer is listed as Georgian businessman and billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili.\n"

In 2008, it was sold by Annibale Berlingieri for $100 million to a private buyer, which at the time was the most valuable work by Andy Warhol. The current owner and location of the painting, which has not been seen publicly since the 1960s, are unknown. \nEight Elvises is composed of eight identical, overlapping images of Elvis Presley in cowboy attire, silkscreened over a silver background. The painting was originally a portion of a 37-foot long (11 m) piece, containing sixteen copies of Elvis, that was showcased in a 1963 exhibition at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. The exhibition, Warhol's second at the Ferus, contained several other pieces using the same image of Elvis, as well as a series of head shots of Elizabeth Taylor. The images of Elvis were taken from a publicity still from the movie Flaming Star. When the gallery was dismantled, the section with eight images of Elvis became a distinct piece, measuring .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}6+1⁄2 by 12 feet (200 by 370 cm). While Warhol created 22 versions of the painting with two Elvises on it, known as Double Elvis, only one piece titled Eight Elvises was created.\nIn 2008, Eight Elvises was sold by Annibale Berlingieri, who had owned it for 40 years it was passed down to her by father who was a family friend of Warhol, in a private sale for $100 million to an unidentified collector. News of the sale, which was not announced publicly at the time, was broken by art writer Sarah Thornton and published in The Economist in late 2009. The deal was brokered by Philippe Ségalot, a New York-based art dealer and one time head of the contemporary art department at Christie's auction house. The sale made Eight Elvises one of the most expensive paintings ever sold, and made Warhol only the fifth artist, behind Pablo Picasso, Gustav Klimt, Jackson Pollock, and Willem de Kooning to have a painting sold for at least $100 million. The current location of the painting is unknown.\nAnother painting from 1963, Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster), broke the valuation record for a Warhol work set by Eight Elvises when it sold for $105.4 million at auction in November 2013.\n"

    "painting_info": "Young Girl with a Flower Basket (French: Fillette à la corbeille fleurie or Jeune fille nue avec panier de fleurs or Fillette nue au panier de fleurs or Le panier fleuri) is a 1905 oil on canvas painting by Pablo Picasso from his Rose Period. The painting depicts a Parisian street girl, named \"Linda\", whose fate is unknown. It was painted at a key phase in Picasso's life, as he made the transition from an impoverished bohemian at the start of 1905 to a successful artist by the end of 1906. The painting is listed as one of the most expensive paintings, after achieving a price of $115 million when it was sold at Christie's on 8 May 2018. It is currently the third highest selling painting by Picasso.\nAfter achieving some early success in 1901, Picasso was still a struggling artist by 1905, living in penury in Montmartre. The work was painted at the new studio that he took on the top floor of the dilapidated building at 13 rue Ravignan, which the poet Max Jacob termed \"Le Bateau-Lavoir\". The Cirque Médrano was situated nearby at the foot of Montmartre, and Picasso was inspired by the harlequins and saltimbanques, clowns, jugglers and other acts, making the transition from his bleak Blue Period to his more optimistic Rose Period.\nYoung Girl with a Flower Basket was created in the autumn of 1905, after Picasso returned to Paris from spending six weeks painting in the countryside in Holland. The experience of his Dutch trip was also coupled with a renewed Parisian interest in classical art, which had great influence on Picasso's work during that year. The art historian Alfred H. Barr, Jr. remarked on the influence of classicism on Picasso during this period.During the second half of the year  work began to assume a classic breadth and repose. Such paintings…reveal the new style, more objective in feeling, more studied in pose, broadly and more solidly modeled, simpler in color. Picasso’s youthful classicism is informal, fresh, unacademic... During this brief moment in his youth he was able to hold in delicate, intuitive balance the human and the ideal, the personal and the traditional.Later in 1905, Henri-Pierre Roché introduced Picasso to the collectors Gertrude Stein and Leo Stein and they became friends, buying Femme au bras levé (1905) direct from the artist. Picasso completed Portrait of Gertrude Stein in 1906. The acquisitions by the Steins were to mark the beginnings of Picassos commercial success, and by the end of 1906 his works were being bought by the influential art dealer Ambroise Vollard.\nThe subject of the painting is a young girl who was working as a flower seller, but also probably as a teenage child prostitute. She is depicted naked, save for pink ribbons in her dark hair and a necklace, and she is holding a basket of red flowers, all painted with simplified lines and flattened blocks of colour. Her silhouette against the blue background appears awkward and her expression is troubled. The painting is signed \"Picasso\" on the upper right corner, and again signed, dated and inscribed \"Picasso 1905 13 Rue Ravignan\" on the reverse. It measures 154.8 cm × 66.1 cm (60.9 in × 26.0 in).\nAccording to Christie’s, Picasso referred to the girl as \"Linda\", which translates as \"pretty\", which could have been a nickname. Her identity and life story remain a mystery. It was reported by John Richardson in his exhibition catalogue for the Late Picasso exhibition at the Tate Gallery in London in 1988 (p. 340), based on the writings of Jean-Paul Crespelle, that the subject was called \"Linda la Bouquetière\", from the Place du Tertre, and she worked outside the Moulin Rouge. She also worked as an artist's model; in addition to Picasso, she was painted by Kees van Dongen and Amedeo Modigliani.\nPicasso's painting of \"Linda\" displays elements of Egyptian art and classicism. Picasso was greatly inspired by the work of the French Neoclassical painter Ingres. This influence can be seen in the awkward side silhouette of the girl, which is reminiscent of ancient Egyptian art. However, the portrait of the girl is realistic rather than an idealised image of a goddess. Her figure is conveyed using simple curves and minimal detail, yet her face is given a more realistic expression.\nMany of Picasso's paintings of this period combine conflicting elements of innocence and experience. In Young Girl with a Flower Basket, the stark contrast between the whiteness of the child's skin and the bright red colour of the flowers in her basket has been considered to be a juxtaposition of chastity and sexuality and of innocence and corruption. Picasso's classical rendering of \"Linda\" was designed to convey an aura of purity that contrasts starkly with the harsh reality of her existence. An earlier pen and ink sketch suggests Picasso originally planned to paint the girl in a white dress, as if attending her first communion, with the red flowers symbolising the blood of the Eucharist. This theme is also exhibited in Garçon à la pipe, the subject of which was described by Picasso as an \"evil angel\". Like Linda's basket of red flowers, he wears a garland of roses to symbolise the blood of the Eucharist. Both paintings describe the transition from youth to maturity and innocence to experience.\nYoung Girl with a Flower Basket has been described as a \"masterpiece, depicting a statuesque nude with a melancholy expression\". The art historian John Richardson described the subject as a \"sultry looking gamin\", while the painting's former owner, Gertrude Stein complained that the girl has \"feet like a monkey\".\nGertrude eventually learned to appreciate the painting, describing it in 1909 as, \"a solid thing, a charming thing, a lovely thing, a perplexing thing, a disconcerting thing, a simple thing, a clear thing, a complicated thing, an interesting thing, a disturbing thing, a repellent thing, a very pretty thing.\"\n\nMarc Porter, Chairman of Christie’s America, summarised the painting's significance and legacy.Picasso, the greatest artist of the 20th century, saw our future in 1905 when he painted Fillette à la corbeille fleurie. She represents the themes that Picasso would wrestle with for his life — love, sex, beauty, tenderness, violence — and all that defines humanity. In this masterpiece, Picasso reveals his singular brilliance in a timeless, mesmerising goddess gazing on the universe.Picasso sold the painting to the Galerie du Vingtième Siècle run by art dealer Clovis Sagot near the gallery of Ambroise Vollard. Sagot drove a hard bargain. He originally offered 700 francs for three works - this painting, and two works in gouache made in the Netherlands. Picasso initially refused, but desperate for money he returned to take up Sagot's offer a few days later. Sagot cannily cut his offer to 500 francs, which Picasso also refused. Forced by his poverty to return to Sagot again some days later, the work was eventually sold for just 75 francs, and put up for sale in Sagot's gallery as La fleur du pavé (\"The flower of the cobblestones\").\nIt became the second of three Rose period paintings acquired by the collectors Gertrude Stein and Leo Stein. The Stein siblings had been living in Paris from 1903, and began collecting contemporary artworks in 1904, buying works by Cézanne, Gauguin and Renoir from Ambroise Vollard. Sagot sold Picasso's Famille d'acrobates avec singe (1905) to Leo Stein, and the couple later acquired Fillette à la corbeille fleurie. The Steins quarrelled about this second purchase, as Leo wanted it but Gertrude did not; in the end Gertrude relented and they bought it for 150 francs.  In time, Gertrude came to appreciate the painting and later acquired Leo's share. In 1938, Gertude Stein wrote that it \"was painted at the great moment of the harlequin period, full of grace and delicacy and charm\".\nAfter Gertrude Stein died, the painting was retained by her estate, and then sold in 1968 to the Syndicate of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, but quickly resold later that year to David Rockefeller and Peggy Rockefeller. After David Rockefeller's death in 2017, it was sold at Christie's on 8 May 2018 with other works from the Rockefeller collection, achieving a sale price of $115 million.\nFamille d'acrobates avec singe, 1905, Göteborgs Konstmuseum\nPortrait of Gertrude Stein, 1906, Metropolitan Museum of Art\n"

He has been critically regarded as one of the major figures of abstract expressionism, and one of the foremost of the color field painters. His paintings explore the sense of place that viewers experience with art, and hence incorporate very simplistic forms to emphasize this feeling.\nBarnett Newman was born in New York City, the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland. He studied philosophy at the City College of New York and worked in his father's business manufacturing clothing. He later made a living as a teacher, writer, and critic. From the 1930s on he made paintings, said to be in an expressionist style, but eventually destroyed all these works. Newman met Annalee Greenhouse in 1934, while both were working as substitute teachers at Grover Cleveland High School; they were married on June 30, 1936.\nWhat is the explanation of the seemingly insane drive of man to be painter and poet if it is not an act of defiance against man's fall and an assertion that he return to the Garden of Eden? For the artists are the first men.Newman wrote catalogue forewords and reviews and also organized exhibitions before becoming a member of the Uptown Group and having his first solo show at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Session at Studio 35: \"We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image.\" Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter on April 9, 1955, \"Letter to Sidney Janis: ... it is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it.\"\nThroughout the 1940s he worked in a surrealist vein before developing his signature style. This is characterized by areas of color separated by thin vertical lines, or \"zips\" as Newman called them. In the first works featuring zips, the color fields are variegated, but later the colors are pure and flat. Newman himself thought that he reached his fully distinct, signature style with the Onement series (from 1948). The zips define the spatial structure of the painting, while simultaneously dividing and uniting the composition. According to Art Historian April Kingsley, the zip in Newman's paintings are 'flashing light of a nuclear explosion and the old testament pillar of fire' thus mixing the paradox of romantic sublime with the depiction of destruction and transcendence. Already 1944 Barnett Newman tried to explain America's newest art movement and included a list of \"the men in the new movement.\" Ex-Surrealists, like Matta are mentioned, Wolfgang Paalen Paalen is mentioned twice together with Gottlieb, Rothko, Pollock, Hofmann, Baziotes, Gorky and others. Motherwell is mentioned with a question mark.\nThe zip remained a constant feature of Newman's work throughout his life. In some paintings of the 1950s, such as The Wild, which is eight feet tall by one and a half inches wide (2.43 meters by 4.1 centimeters), the zip is all there is to the work. Newman also made a few sculptures which are essentially three-dimensional zips.: 511 \nAlthough Newman's paintings appear to be purely abstract, and many of them were originally untitled, the names he later gave them hinted at specific subjects being addressed, often with a Jewish theme. Two paintings from the early 1950s, for example, are called Adam and Eve. There is also Uriel (1954), and Abraham (1949), a very dark painting which, as well as being the name of a biblical patriarch, was also the name of Newman's father, who had died in 1947.\nThe Stations of the Cross series of black and white paintings (1958–1966), begun shortly after Newman had recovered from a heart attack, is usually regarded as the peak of his achievement. The series is subtitled Lema sabachthani - \"Why have you forsaken me\" - the last words spoken by Jesus on the cross, according to the New Testament. Newman saw these words as having universal significance in his own time. The series has also been seen as a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust.\nNewman's late works, such as the Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue series, use vibrant, pure colors, often on very large canvases - Anna's Light (1968), named in memory of his mother, who had died in 1965, is his largest work, 28 feet wide by 9 feet tall (8.5 by 2.7 meters). Newman also worked on shaped canvases late in life, with Chartres (1969), for example, being triangular, and returned to sculpture, making a small number of sleek pieces in steel. These later paintings are executed in acrylic paint rather than the oil paint of earlier pieces. Of his sculptures, Broken Obelisk (1963) is the most monumental and best-known, depicting an inverted obelisk whose point balances on the apex of a pyramid.\nNewman also made a series of lithographs, the 18 Cantos (1963–64) which, according to Newman, are meant to be evocative of music. He also made a small number of etchings.\nIn 1948, Newman, William Baziotes, Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell and David Hare founded the Subjects of the Artist School at 35 East 8th Street. Well attended lectures there were open to the public, with speakers such as Jean Arp, John Cage and Ad Reinhardt, but the art school failed financially and closed in the spring of 1949. Newman is generally classified as an abstract expressionist on account of his working in New York City in the 1950s, associating with other artists of the group and developing an abstract style which owed little or nothing to European art. However, his rejection of the expressive brushwork employed by other abstract expressionists such as Clyfford Still and Mark Rothko, and his use of hard-edged areas of flat color, can be seen as a precursor to post painterly abstraction and the minimalist works of artists such as Frank Stella.\nNewman was unappreciated as an artist for much of his life, being overlooked in favor of more colorful characters such as Jackson Pollock. The influential critic Clement Greenberg wrote enthusiastically about him, but it was not until the end of his life that he began to be taken seriously. He was, however, an important influence on many younger artists such as Donald Judd, Frank Stella and Bob Law.: 512 \nNewman died in 1970 of a heart attack in New York City.\nNine years after Newman's death, his widow Annalee founded the Barnett Newman Foundation. The foundation not only functions as his official estate, but also serves \"to encourage the study and understanding of Barnett Newman's life and works.\" The foundation was instrumental in creating Newman's catalogue raisonné in 2004. The U.S. copyright representative for the Barnett Newman Foundation is the Artists Rights Society.\nIn 2018, the Foundation gave more than 70 artworks to the Jewish Museum, New York.\nSeveral public collections hold works by Barnett Newman. These include:\nAfter Newman had an artistic breakthrough in 1948, he and his wife decided that he should devote all his energy to his art. They lived almost entirely off Annalee Newman's teaching salary until the late 1950s, when Newman's paintings began to sell consistently. Ulysses (1952), a blue-and-black striped painting, sold in 1985 for $1,595,000 at Sotheby's to an American collector who was not identified. Consigned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and previously part of Frederick R. Weisman's collection, Newman's 8.5-by-10-foot Onement VI (1953) was sold for a record $43.8 million at Sotheby's New York in 2013; its sale was ensured by an undisclosed third-party guarantee. This was eclipsed on May 13, 2014 when Black Fire 1 sold for $84.2 million.\nIn May 2014, Christie's set an auction record for the artist, with his work Black Fire I selling for $84 million.\n"

    "painting_info": "Untitled is a painting created by American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat in 1982. The artwork, which depicts a skull, is among the most expensive paintings ever. In May 2017, it sold for $110.5 million at Sotheby's, the highest price ever paid at auction for artwork by an American artist in a public sale. That record was surpassed by Shot Sage Blue Marilyn by Andy Warhol, which sold for $195 million in May 2022.\nUntitled was executed by Jean-Michel Basquiat in 1982, which is considered his most valuable year. A majority of the highest-selling Basquiat paintings at auction date to 1982. Untitled depicts a skull, composed of black brushstrokes with red, yellow and white rivulets against a blue background. It originally sold for $4,000 in 1982. It was owned by the Annina Nosei Gallery in New York, before being sold to Phoebe Chason, who sold it to Alexander F. Milliken in 1982. It hadn't been shown in public since it was sold at Christie's to Emily and Jerry Spiegel for $19,000 in 1984.\nIn May 2017, the painting was auctioned at Sotheby's to Japanese businessman and art collector Yusaku Maezawa for $110.5 million, which far exceeded the pre-sale estimate of $60 million. Basquiat, who was 21-years-old when he painted Untitled, is the youngest artist to eclipse the $100 million mark. It is also the first work made after 1980 to sell for more than $100 million. It surpassed Andy Warhol's $105 million auction record for Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster) (1963), and became the sixth-most expensive work ever auctioned. Basquiat's previous record was $57.3 million for Untitled (1982), a painting of a devil, also purchased by Maezawa.\nUntitled was exhibited for the group show Fast at Alexander F. Milliken Inc. in New York, June–July 1982. After Yusaku Maezawa purchased the painting, he loaned it to the Brooklyn Museum and the Seattle Art Museum in 2018. Maezawa plans to open a contemporary art museum in his hometown of Chiba, Japan, which will house the painting with the rest of his art collection. It was on display for the Jean-Michel Basquiat exhibition at the Brant Foundation in New York, March–May 2019.\n"

    "painting_info": "\nThe portraits of Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) are the self-portraits, portraits of him by other artists, and photographs—one of which is dubious—of the Dutch artist. Van Gogh's dozens of self-portraits were an important part of his œuvre as a painter. Most probably, van Gogh's self-portraits are depicting the face as it appeared in the mirror he used to reproduce his face, i.e. his right side in the image is in reality the left side of his face.\nOn July 14, 2022, an almost certainly authentic self-portrait of van Gogh was found in Scotland behind his 1885 painting \"Head of a peasant woman\". Lesley Stevenson, a conservator at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, discovered it during an X-ray examination of their existing pieces. It shows a bearded van Gogh in a brimmed hat and a neckerchief around his throat. His left ear was clearly visible. The portrait is covered under layers of cardboard and glue, which experts are searching for ways to remove in order to confirm its authenticity. They believe it was painted when van Gogh moved to France and learnt about the work of the impressionists there, an experience that influenced his more colourful and expressive style that is much admired today. The Dutch painter is known to often reuse his canvases or work on their reverse in order to save money. The X-ray image will be featured at a Royal Scottish Academy exhibit in Edinburgh and displayed using a specially made lightbox.\nThe first self-portrait by van Gogh that survived, is dated 1886.\n Two Self-Portraits and Several Details, Drawing, Paris, 1886Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F1378r)\nSelf-Portrait with Dark Felt Hat at the Easel, 1886Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F181)\nSelf-Portrait with Pipe, 1886Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F208)\nSelf-Portrait with Pipe, 1886Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F180)\nSelf-Portrait with Dark Felt Hat, 1886Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F208a)\nSelf-Portrait, Autumn 1886, ParisGemeentemuseum Den Haag, The Hague (F187v)\nSelf-Portrait, Winter 1886/87 Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford (F 268)\nSelf-Portrait, Winter 1886/87 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F 269v)\nSelf-Portrait, Winter 1886/87 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F 267)\nSelf-Portrait, Winter 1886/87 Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo (F 380)\nSelf-Portrait, 1887Oil on pasteboard, 42 cm x 34 cmRijksmuseum, Amsterdam (F295)\nSelf-Portrait with Pipe and Glass, 1887Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F263a)\nSelf-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat, March/April 1887Oil on pasteboard, 19 × 14 cmVan Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F296)\nSelf-Portrait, 1887Oil on artist's board, mounted on cradled panel, 41 × 32.5 cmArt Institute of Chicago (F 345)\nSelf-Portrait with Straw Hat, Summer 1887Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F469)\nSelf-Portrait with Straw Hat (reverse image), 1887Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F61v)\nSelf-Portrait with Straw Hat, Summer 1887  Oil on pasteboard, 34.9 × 26.7 cmDetroit Institute of Arts (F526)\nSelf-Portrait with Straw Hat, 1887 Metropolitan Museum of Art (F365v)\nSelf-Portrait with Straw Hat and a Pipe (reverse image), 1887Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F179v)\nSelf-Portrait, Summer 1887Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F 356)\nSelf-Portrait, Summer 1887, ParisVan Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F77v)\nSelf-Portrait, Summer 1887, ParisVan Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F109v)\nSelf-Portrait, Autumn 1887Oil on canvas, 47 × 35 cmMusée d'Orsay, Paris (F320)\nSelf-Portrait with Japanese print December, 1887Kunstmuseum, Basel (on loan from Emily Dreyfus Foundation) (F319)\nSelf-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat, Winter 1887/88 Oil on canvas, 44 × 37.5 cmVan Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F344)\nSelf-Portrait, 1887–88, (F1672a)\nSelf-Portrait, 1887-88Foundation E.G.

In 1970, the editors of De la Faille's posthumous manuscript brand marked most of these dubious Self-portraits as forgeries, but could not settle all disputes, at least on one:\nMeanwhile, the authenticity of a second \"self-portrait\" has been challenged:\nNote the painter shows his right ear, if painted via a mirror, while Van Gogh cut his left ear.\nJohn Russell, Vincent van Gogh, 1886, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Portrait of Vincent van Gogh, 1887, pastel on cardboard, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam\nPaul Gauguin, The Painter of Sunflowers, 1888, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam\nPhotograph of Theo van Gogh, age 13, 1866\nPhotograph of Vincent van Gogh, age 19, c. 1873\nPhoto by Victor Morin, c. 1886, Quebec.

    "short_description": "1890–91 Series of paintings by Claude Monet",
    "painting_info": "\nHaystacks is the common English title for a series of impressionist paintings by Claude Monet. The principal subject of each painting in the series is stacks of harvested wheat (or possibly barley or oats: the original French title, Les Meules à Giverny, simply means The Stacks at Giverny). The title refers primarily to a twenty-five canvas series (Wildenstein Index Numbers 1266–1290) which Monet began near the end of the summer of 1890 and continued through the following spring, though Monet also produced five earlier paintings using this same stack subject.\nThe series is famous for the way in which Monet repeated the same subject to show the differing light and atmosphere at different times of day, across the seasons and in many types of weather.\nThe series is among Monet's most notable work. The largest Haystacks collections are held at the Musée d'Orsay and Musée Marmottan Monet in Paris, and in the Art Institute of Chicago. Other collections include the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Metropolitan Museum and Museum of Modern Art in New York, the National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo,  and the Musée de l'Orangerie in Paris. The Art Institute of Chicago collection includes six of the twenty-five Haystacks. \nOther museums that hold parts of this series include the Getty Center in Los Angeles, the Hill-Stead Museum in Farmington, Connecticut (which also has one of five from the earlier 1888–89 harvest), the Scottish National Gallery, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Kunsthaus Zürich, Tel Aviv Museum of Art and the Shelburne Museum,  Vermont. Private collections hold the remaining Haystacks paintings.\nMonet settled in Giverny in 1883. Most of his paintings from 1883 until his death 40 years later were of scenes within 3 kilometres (2 mi) of his home and gardens. Monet was intensely aware of and fascinated by the visual nuances of the region’s landscape and by the endless variations in the days and in the seasons—the stacks were just outside his door.\nMonet had previously painted a single subject in different light and different moods. However, as he matured as a painter, his depictions of atmospheric influences were increasingly concerned not only with specific effects but with the overall color harmonies that allowed him an autonomous use of rich color. The conventional wisdom was that the stacks were a simple subject but also an unimaginative one. However, contemporary writers and friends of the artist noted that Monet's subject matter was always carefully chosen, the product of careful thought and analysis.  Monet undertook to capture the stacks in direct light and then to re-examine them from the same view-point in different, often more muted, light and atmospheric conditions. It was then not unusual for Monet, in search of harmonious transitions within the series, to alter the canvases back in his studio.\nThe stacks depicted in the series are commonly referred to in English as hay, wheat or grain-stacks. In reality they stored sheafs of grain primarily for bread—so wheat —and not hay, an animal food. The 10-to-20-foot (3.0 to 6.1 m) stacks were a way of keeping the sheafs dry until the grain could be separated from the stalks by threshing. The local method of storing and drying unthreshed-grains was to use straw, or sometimes hay, as a thatched 'roof' for the stack, shielding the wheat, barley or oats from the elements until, once dry-enough, they could be threshed. The threshing machines then traveled from village to village. Thus, although the grain was harvested and the stacks were built by July, it often took until the following spring or even later—so through all the light and atmosphere changes of summer, autumn, winter and spring—for all the stacks to be reached by the threshing-machines. Grain storage/drying-stacks like these became common throughout Europe in the 19th century and survived until the inception of combine harvesters. The shapes of stacks were regional: in Normandy, where Giverny is situated, it was common for them to be round with quite steeply-pitched thatched 'roofs'—just as Monet painted.\nThe stacks belonged to Monet's farmer-neighbour, Monsieur Quéruel. Noticing the way the light changed on M. Quéruel's stacks, Monet asked his stepdaughter, Blanche Hoschedé, to bring him two canvases, one for sunny and one for overcast conditions. But Monet soon found he could not catch the ever-changing light and mood on merely two canvases: as a result, his willing helper was quickly bringing as many canvases as her wheelbarrow could hold. Monet's daily routine therefore came to involve carting paints, easels and many unfinished canvases back and forth, working on whichever canvas most closely resembled the scene of the moment as the conditions and light fluctuated. Although he began painting the stacks en plein air, Monet later revised his initial impressions in his studio, both to generate contrast and to preserve the harmony within the series.\nMonet produced numerous Haystacks paintings. He painted five paintings (Wildenstein Index Numbers 1213–1217) with stacks as his primary subject during the 1888 harvest. His earlier landscapes (Wildenstein Index Number 900–995, 1073) had included stacks  in an ancillary manner. The general consensus is that only the canvases produced using the 1890 harvest (Wildenstein Index Number 1266–1290) comprise the Haystacks series proper. However some commentators include additional paintings when referencing this series. For example, the Hill-Stead Museum talk of their two stack paintings even though one is from the 'proper' 1890 harvest, the other from the 1888 harvest. \nMonet's Haystacks series is one of his earliest to rely on repetition to illustrate nuances in his perception across natural variations such as times of day, seasons, and types of weather.  For Monet, the concept of producing and exhibiting a series of paintings related by subject and vantage point began in 1889, with at least ten paintings done at the Valley of the Creuse, and subsequently shown at the Galerie Georges Petit. This interest in the serial motif would continue for the rest of his career.\nAlthough the mundane subject was constant throughout the Haystack series, the underlying theme may be seen as the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception as the time of day, the seasons and the weather changed. The almost unvarying subject provided the basis for him to compare changes of light and mood across his nuanced series. The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.\nBeginning in the 1880s and 1890s, Monet focused on Haystacks and a number of other subjects (other series included the Mornings on the Seine, Poplars, Rouen Cathedral, the Houses of Parliament, and the Water Lilies, among others). In order to work on many paintings virtually simultaneously, he would awake before dawn so as to begin at the earliest time of day:\n... for the Early Mornings on the Seine series, he chose to paint at and before dawn, which made it 'an easier subject and simpler lighting than usual', because at this time of day the effects did not change so rapidly; however, this involved him getting up at 3:30 a.m., which seems to have been unprecedented even for so inveterate an early riser as Monet.\"As the morning progressed and the light changed he would switch to sequentially later canvas settings, sometimes working on as many as ten or twelve paintings a day, each one depicting a slightly different aspect of light. The process would be repeated over the course of days, weeks, or months, depending on the weather and the progress of the paintings until they were completed. As the seasons changed the process was renewed.\nCertain effects of light only last for a few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera received attention for no more than a few minutes a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.\n\nMany notable painters have been influenced by this particular series, including Les Fauves, Derain, and Vlaminck. Kandinsky's memoirs refer to the series: “What suddenly became clear to me was the unsuspected power of the palette, which I had not understood before and which surpassed my wildest dreams.” The Haystacks series was a financial success. Fifteen of these were exhibited by Durand-Ruel in May 1891, and most of the paintings were sold within a month. They were especially popular among collectors from America, with twenty out of the thirty Haystacks created landing in American collections. Of the American collectors, Bertha Honoré Palmer bought nine of Monet's Haystacks. The 1891 exhibit met with great public acclaim. Octave Mirbeau described Monet's daring series as representing \"what lies beyond progress itself.\" Others described the stacks as \"faces of the landscape\"—they represented the countryside as a retreat from daily problems and home for contentment with nature. Camille Pissarro said: \"These canvases breathe contentment.\" Most of the paintings sold immediately for as much as 1,000 francs. Additionally, Monet’s prices, in general, began to rise steeply. As a result, he was able to buy outright the house and grounds at Giverny and to start constructing a waterlily pond. After years of mere subsistence living, he was able to enjoy success.\nThe series demonstrates his intense study of light and atmospheric conditions and Monet was a perfectionist in his renderings. Monet destroyed more than one series of paintings that he found wanting. However, this series escaped his own harsh self-criticism and destruction.\nFrom the 1888 harvest, Monet produced three canvases featuring two stacks each (Wildenstein #'s 1213–5) against the backdrop of hills along the left bank of the Seine and a few Giverny houses to the right. Then, he turned to his left to capture two scenes (1216–7) in which the hills are shrouded by a line of poplars.\nGrainstacks at Giverny, sunset, 1888–89.

The buyer of the work was Hasso Plattner. Since September 2020, the painting is on display at the Museum Barberini in Potsdam.\nClimate activists threw mashed potatoes at the painting in October 2022, but it was not damaged and was cleaned and put back on display. \nStacks, End of Summer,  (Meules, fin de l'été), 1891.

    "painting_info": "\nThe Massacre of the Innocents is the subject of two paintings by Peter Paul Rubens depicting the episode of the biblical Massacre of the Innocents of Bethlehem, as related in the Gospel of Matthew (2:13-18). The first, measuring 142 x 182 cm, was painted after his return to his native Antwerp in 1608, following eight years spent in Italy.\nThe first version painted by Rubens dates from around 1611–12. At the end of the seventeenth century, the painting became part of the Liechtenstein Collection in Vienna, Austria, along with another Rubens painting, Samson and Delilah. The Forchondt brothers sold both paintings to Hans-Adam I, Prince of Liechtenstein whom they knew through his father Karl Eusebius, Prince of Liechtenstein around 1700. The paintings were given the Liechtenstein family seal and are recorded in the collection until the 19th century, where drawings in 1815 show they hung side by side in the Garden Palace in Vienna. \nAfter being catalogued by Vincenzio Fanti as a Franciscus de Neve (II) in 1767, the Massacre was attributed in an anonymous inventory of the Liechtenstein Collection dated 1780 to one of Rubens' assistants, Jan van den Hoecke, after Rubens. \nThe composition was already known from what is now seen as a copy by Rubens' workshop. This was bought in 1902 by the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels as a work by Antoon Sallaert. Under that attribution it remained until it was sold to an Austrian family in 1920. It was subsequently loaned in 1923 to Stift Reichersberg, a monastery in northern Austria. \nIn 2001, the painting was seen by George Gordon, an expert in Flemish and Dutch paintings at Sotheby's in London. He was persuaded that it was indeed a Rubens by its similar characteristics and style to the Samson and Delilah painted around the same time. The work was sold at auction at Sotheby's, London on July 10, 2002, for £49.5 million (C$117 million) to Canadian businessman and art collector Kenneth Thomson, 2nd Baron Thomson of Fleet. \nFollowing the auction the painting was loaned to the National Gallery, London for a period before its transfer in 2008 to the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, to whom Thomson had donated it, and which was undergoing a major rebuilding and expansion during those years.\nTowards the end of his life, between 1636 and 1638, Rubens painted a second version of the Massacre of the Innocents. This version was acquired by the Alte Pinakothek, Munich by 1706, where it remains.\nA copy of this later version was made as an engraving in 1643 by Paulus Pontius.\nIt is widely regarded as a demonstration of the artist's learnings from his time spent in Italy between 1600 and 1608, where he observed first-hand the works of Italian Baroque painters like Caravaggio. These influences are seen in this painting through the sheer drama and emotive dynamism of the scene, as well as the rich colour. There is also evidence of the use of chiaroscuro. He also used écorché figures - anatomical statues with the skin removed-to study how the body was made.\nAt the time of Rubens' first painting on the subject Antwerp had been involved in warfare only a few years before- a conflict temporarily frozen by the truce of 1609. In one year alone over 8,000 citizens had been killed by Calvinists and Catholics alike as the  Spanish forces ruling the Netherlands sought to repel Protestant armies.  Massacres were a reality in Antwerp; 160 kilometres (100 mi) north of the city the Protestant rebel leader Prince Mauritz commissioned Cornelis van Haarlem to paint the same scene for Haarlem's town hall,- propaganda intended to tell of Spanish atrocities against the Dutch people.  Antwerp however remained a Catholic stronghold and became a leading centre of Counter Reformation thought.\n Media related to Massacre of the Innocents (Rubens) at Wikimedia Commons\n"

    "painting_info": "\nLes Noces de Pierrette (English:The marriage of Pierrette) is a 1905 painting by the Spanish artist and sculptor Pablo Picasso. While belonging chronologically to Picasso's Rose Period, it is artistically characteristic of the Blue Period, when the artist faced poverty and depression following the suicide of his friend Carlos Casagemas in 1901.\nThe painting was acquired in 1907 by Josef Stránský, an art dealer and a friend of Picasso's. From 1945 to 1962, the painting was owned by Picasso's son Paulo Picasso.\nAround 1930, Georges Renand, owner of La Samaritaine department store, purchased the work. The painting was owned by the Swedish investment banker and merchant Fredrik Roos when it was sold at Binoche et Godeau in Paris on November 30, 1989. The buyer, Tomonori Tsurumaki, a real-estate developer, investment banker and owner of Autopolis racetrack, purchased the painting for the sum of $51,670,000, making it one of the world's most expensive paintings.\nWith the collapse of Tsurumaki's company, Nippon Tri-Trust, the painting ended up in the hands of the construction company Hazama, which had constructed Tsurumaki's racetrack. Hazama, having run into financial difficulties, put the painting up as collateral when the firm took a loan from Lake Credit Company. Thus, Lake Credit Company came into possession of  Les Noces de Pierrette. When Lake Credit Company sold its stake in the mainline consumer loan business to GE Capital,  Les Noces de Pierrette (along with 500 other paintings worth approximately $200 million) became the property of GE Capital. Presently, Les Noces de Pierrette is secured in the vault of Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings (formerly the Mitsui Trust Bank).  It was offered at $54 million in 1994 with no takers, and again, also with no takers in 1997 at $35 million. The Japanese operation of GE Capital was subsequently sold to Shinsei Bank in 2008, along with its art collection portfolio.\n"

    "short_description": "American painter (born 1930)",
    "painting_info": "\n\nJasper Johns (born May 15, 1930) is an American painter, sculptor, and printmaker whose work is associated with abstract expressionism, Neo-Dada, and pop art. He is well known for his depictions of the American flag and other US-related topics. Johns's works regularly sell for millions of dollars at sale and auction, including a reported $110 million sale in 2010. At multiple times works by Johns have held the title of most paid for a work by a living artist.\nJohns has received many honors throughout his career, including the National Medal of Arts in 1990 and Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2007. In 2018, The New York Times called him the United States' \"foremost living artist.\"\nBorn in Augusta, Georgia, Jasper Johns spent his early life in Allendale, South Carolina, with his paternal grandparents after his parents' marriage failed. He then spent a year living with his mother in Columbia, South Carolina, and thereafter, several years living with his Aunt Gladys in Lake Murray, South Carolina, twenty-two miles from Columbia. He spent time with his father Jasper, Sr and stepmother, Geraldine Sineath Johns, who encouraged his art by buying materials for him to draw and paint. He completed Edmunds High School (now Sumter High School) class of 1947 in Sumter, South Carolina, where he once again lived with his mother. Recounting this period in his life, he  said, \"In the place where I was a child, there were no artists and there was no art, so I really didn't know what that meant. I think I thought it meant that I would be in a situation different than the one that I was in.\"\nJohns studied a total of three semesters at the University of South Carolina, from 1947 to 1948. He then moved to New York City and studied briefly at the Parsons School of Design in 1949. In 1952 and 1953, he was stationed in Sendai, Japan, during the Korean War.\nIn 1954, after returning to New York, Johns met Robert Rauschenberg and they became long-term lovers. For a time they lived in the same building as Rachel Rosenthal. During the same period he was strongly influenced by the gay couple Merce Cunningham (a choreographer) and John Cage (a composer). Working together they explored the contemporary art scene, and began developing their ideas on art.\nIn 1958, gallery owner Leo Castelli discovered Johns while visiting Rauschenberg's studio. “And we went down,\" Castelli remembered.  \"And then I was confronted with that miraculous array of unprecedented images -- flags, red, white and blue... All white... Large ones... small ones, targets... numbers, alphabets. Just an incredible sight ... Something one could not imagine, new and out of the blue.\" Castelli immediately offered Johns his first solo show. It was here that Alfred Barr, the founding director of New York's Museum of Modern Art, purchased four works from this show. In 1960 he received the Vincent van Volkmer Prize. In 1963, Johns and Cage founded the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts, now known as the Foundation for Contemporary Arts in New York City.\nJohns currently lives in Sharon, Connecticut, and on the island of Saint Martin. Until 2012, he lived in a rustic 1930s farmhouse with a glass-walled studio in Stony Point, New York. He first began visiting Saint Martin in the late 1960s and bought the property there in 1972. The architect Philip Johnson is the principal designer of his Saint Martin home, a long, white, rectangular structure divided into three distinct sections.\nJohns is best known for his series of flags, maps, targets, letters and numbers, a practice he began in 1954 after burning all his previous artwork. He started introducing text and numbers into his abstract paintings, such as Gray Numbers (1957) and False Start (1959), thus reinstating content. His use of defined or extant symbols differentiated his paintings from the gestural abstraction of the Abstract Expressionists, whose paintings were often understood as expressive of the individual personality or psychology of the artist. Because Johns imported well-known motifs into the fine arts, his paintings could be read as both representational (a flag, a target) and as abstract patterns (stripes, circles). Some art historians and museums characterize his choice of subjects as freeing him from decisions about composition. Johns has remarked: \"What’s interesting to me is the fact that it isn’t designed, but taken. It’s not mine,” or, that these motifs are \"things the mind already knows.\"\nHis encaustic painting Flag (1954–55), which he painted after having a dream of the American flag, marks the beginning of this new period. Flag allowed Johns to create a painting that was not completely abstract because it depicted a symbol (the American flag), yet drew attention to the graphic design of the symbol itself; was not personal because it was a national symbol, and yet, retained a sense of the handmade in the wax brushstrokes; and was not itself a literal flag, yet was not simply a painting. The painting raises a set of complex questions with no clear answers through its combination of symbol and medium. Museum of Modern Art director Alfred H. Barr had to convince the museum trustees to buy the painting, as they were afraid its ambiguity might lead to boycott or attack by patriotic groups. Johns has made over forty variations of American flag paintings.\nHe also often used plaster reliefs in his paintings (such as Targets with Four Faces, 1955), which challenge typical conceptions of paintings as two-dimensional. Johns often used encaustic as a painting method to create bumpy, textured surfaces unusual in painting. Johns' 2020 work Slice includes a drawing of a knee by Jéan-Marc Togodgue, a Cameroonian emigre student basketball player who attends the Salisbury School near John's estate in Sharon. Johns' use of Togodgue's artwork without first notifying him led to a dispute which was settled amicably.\nJohns makes his sculptures in wax first, working the surfaces in a complex pattern of textures, often layering collaged elements such as impressions of newsprint, or of a key, a cast of his friend Merce Cunningham's foot, or one of his own hand. He then casts the waxes in bronze, and, finally, works over the surface again, applying the patina. Flashlight is one of his earliest pedestal-based sculptures. One sculpture, a double-sided relief titled Fragment of a Letter (2009), incorporates part of a letter from Vincent van Gogh to his friend, the artist Émile Bernard. Using blocks of type, Johns pressed the letters of van Gogh's words into the wax. On the other side he spelled out the letter in the American Sign Language alphabet with stamps he made himself. Finally, he signed his name in the wax with his hands in sign language. Numbers (2007) is the largest single bronze Johns has made and depicts his now classic pattern of stenciled numerals repeated in a grid.\nJohns also produces intaglio prints, sculptures and lithographs. Since 1960 Johns has worked closely with Universal Limited Art Editions, Inc (ULAE) in a variety of printmaking techniques to investigate and develop existing compositions. Initially, lithography suited Johns and enabled him to create print versions of iconic depictions of flags, maps, and targets that filled his paintings. In 1971, Johns became the first artist at ULAE to use the handfed offset lithographic press, resulting in Decoy — an image realized in printmaking before it was made in drawing or painting. However, apart from the Lead Reliefs series of 1969, he has concentrated his efforts on lithography at Gemini G.E.L. In 1976, Johns partnered with writer Samuel Beckett to create Foirades/Fizzles; the book includes 33 etchings, which revisit an earlier work by Johns and five text fragments by Beckett. He has also worked with Atelier Crommelynck in Paris, in association with Petersburg Press of London and New York; and Simca Print Artists in New York. In 2000, Johns produced a limited-edition linocut for the Grenfell Press.\nIn 1973, Johns produced a print called Cup 2 Picasso, for XXe siècle, a French publication. For the May 2014 issue of Art in America, he created a black-and-white lithograph depicting many of his signature motifs, including numbers, a map of the United States and sign language.\nFor decades Johns worked with others to raise both funds and attention for Merce Cunningham's choreography. He privately assisted Robert Rauschenberg in some of his 1950s designs for Cunningham. In spring 1963, Johns helped start the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts, then intended to sponsor and raise funds in the performance field; the other founders were John Cage, Elaine de Kooning, the designer David Hayes, and the theater producer Lewis B. Lloyd. Johns later was the Merce Cunningham Dance Company's artistic adviser from 1967 to 1980. In 1968 Johns and Cunningham made a Duchamp-inspired theater piece, Walkaround Time, in which Johns's décor replicates elements of Duchamp's work The Large Glass (1915–23). Earlier, Johns also wrote neodada lyrics for The Druds, a short-lived avant-garde noise music art band that featured prominent members of the New York proto-conceptual art and minimal art community. Johns himself was a subject of a painting when Chuck Close painted him in one of his large scale portraits in 1998.\nIn 1964, architect Philip Johnson, a friend, commissioned Johns to make a piece for what is now the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center. After presiding over the theatre's lobby for 35 years, Numbers (1964), an enormous 9-foot-by-7-foot grid of numerals, was supposed to be sold by the center for a reported $15 million. Art historians consider Numbers a historically important work in part because it is the largest of the artist's numbers motifs and the only one where each unit is on a separate stretcher, fashioned from a material called Sculpmetal, which was chosen by the artist for its durability. Responding to widespread criticism, the board of Lincoln Center had to drop its selling plans.\nJohns's work is sometimes grouped in with Neo-Dadaist and pop art: he uses symbols in the Dada tradition of the readymades of Marcel Duchamp, but unlike many Pop artists like Andy Warhol, he does not engage with celebrity culture. Other scholars and museums position Johns and Rauschenberg as predecessors of Pop Art.\nIn 1998, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York bought Johns's White Flag. While the Museum would not disclose how much was paid, The New York Times reported that \"experts estimate  value at more than $20 million\". The National Gallery of Art acquired about 1,700 of Johns's proofs in 2007. This made the gallery home to the largest number of Johns's works held by a single institution. The exhibition showed works from many points in Johns's career, including recent proofs of his prints. The Greenville County Museum of Art in Greenville, South Carolina, has several of his pieces in their permanent collection.\nJohns was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1984. In 1990, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts. On February 15, 2011, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama, becoming the first painter or sculptor to receive a Presidential Medal of Freedom since Alexander Calder in 1977. In 1990 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1994. In 1994 he was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal.\nHis text Statement (1959) has been published in Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings.\nSince the 1980s, Johns typically produces only four to five paintings a year; some years he produces none. His large-scale paintings are much favored by collectors and because of their rarity are extremely difficult to acquire. His works from the mid to late 1950s, typically viewed as his period of rebellion against abstract expressionism, remain his most sought after. Skate's Art Market Research (Skate Press, Ltd.), a New York-based advisory firm servicing private and institutional investors in the art market, has ranked Jasper Johns as the 30th most valuable artist in the world. The firm's index of the 1,000 most valuable works of art sold at auction—Skate's Top 1000—contains 7 works by Johns.\nIn 1980 the Whitney Museum of American Art paid $1 million for Three Flags (1958), then the highest price ever paid for the work of a living artist. In 1988, Johns's False Start was sold at auction at Sotheby's to Samuel I. Newhouse, Jr., for $17.05 million, setting a record at the time as the highest price paid for a work by a living artist at auction, and the second highest price paid for an artwork at auction in the U.S. In 2006, private collectors Anne and Kenneth Griffin (founder of the Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel LLC) bought False Start (1959) from David Geffen for $80 million, making it the most expensive painting by a living artist. On November 11, 2014, a 1983 version of Flag was auctioned at Sotheby's in New York for $36 million, establishing a new auction record for Johns.\nIn 2010, Flag (1958), one of a series, was sold privately to hedge fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen for a reported $110 million (then £73 million; €81.7 million). The seller was Jean-Christophe Castelli, son of Leo Castelli, Johns's legendary dealer, who had died in 1999. While the price was not disclosed by the parties, art experts say Cohen paid about $110 million. \"Flags\" are Johns's most famous works. The artist painted his first American flag in 1954–1955, a work now at the MoMA.\n"

    "painting_info": "A Wheatfield with Cypresses is any of three similar 1889 oil paintings by Vincent van Gogh, as part of his wheat field series.  All were exhibited at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole mental asylum at Saint-Rémy near Arles, France, where Van Gogh was voluntarily a patient from May 1889 to May 1890.  The works were inspired by the view from the window at the asylum towards the Alpilles mountains.\nThe painting depicts golden fields of ripe wheat, a dark fastigiate Provençal cypress towering like a green obelisk to the right and lighter green olive trees in the middle distance, with hills and mountains visible behind, and white clouds swirling in an azure sky above.  The first version (F717)  was painted in late June or early July 1889, during a period of frantic painting and shortly after Van Gogh completed The Starry Night, at a time when he was fascinated by the cypress.  It is likely to have been painted \"en plein air\", near the subject, when Van Gogh was able to leave the precincts of the asylum.  Van Gogh regarded this work as one of his best summer paintings.  In a letter to his brother, Theo, written on 2 July 1889, Vincent described the painting: \"I have a canvas of cypresses with some ears of wheat, some poppies, a blue sky like a piece of Scotch plaid; the former painted with a thick impasto like the Monticelli's, and the wheat field in the sun, which represents the extreme heat, very thick too.\"\nVan Gogh had to take time off painting in order to deal with some severe problems due to mental illness in late July and early August, but was able to resume painting in late August and early September 1889.  After making a reed-pen drawing of the work, now held by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, he copied the composition twice in oils in his studio, one approximately the same size (F615) and a smaller version (F743).  The larger studio version was probably painted in a single sitting, with a few minor later adjustments adding touches of yellow and brown.  Van Gogh sketched out the design with charcoal underdrawing; he applied thin paint on the cypress trees and sky, with the ground allowed to show in places, and thick impasto for the foreground wheat and the clouds above.  Characteristically, he preferred the brilliant white of zinc white (zinc oxide) for the white clouds rather than lead white, despite its poor drying qualities, with his palette also including cobalt blue for the sky, shades of chrome yellow for the wheat field, viridian and emerald green for the bushes and cypresses, and touches of vermilion for the poppies in the foreground and also synthetic ultramarine.  The July \"plein air\" version was much more heavily worked, and may be considered a study for the more considered September studio painting.  He sent the smaller and less accomplished studio version to his mother and sister as a gift.\nVincent sent the larger July and September versions to his brother in Paris later in September 1889.  The July version was sold by Theo's widow in 1900 to artist Émile Schuffenecker.  It passed through the hands of collector Alexandre Berthier and art dealer Paul Cassirer in Paris, where it was first exhibited and photographed at Galerie Eugène Druet in November 1909.  It was sold to banker Franz von Mendelssohn (1865–1935) in Berlin in 1910 and remained with the Mendelssohn family in Germany and Switzerland until it was sold to industrialist Emil Bührle in Zurich in 1952.  His son, Dieter Bührle, bought the painting in 1993, and subsequently donated it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, for $57 million using funds donated by publisher, diplomat and philanthropist Walter Annenberg.\nThe National Gallery in London holds a similar version painted in Van Gogh's studio in September 1889, bought with the Courtauld Fund in 1923.  It is unlined, and was never varnished or waxed.  The third smaller version is held by a private collection (sold at Sotheby's in London in 1970; in the US in 1987).\nReed-pen drawing, held by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (F1538)\nSmall version in a private collection, 51.5 cm (20.3 in) by 65 cm (26 in) (F743), September 1889\n"

    "painting_info": "Yo, Picasso (English: I, Picasso), is an oil-on-canvas painting by Pablo Picasso, which he painted in 1901. It is a self-portrait of the artist that depicts him in his youth, aged 19. The painting was created at the beginning of Picasso's Blue Period. On 9 May 1989, the painting sold at Sotheby's, achieving a price of $47.85 million, making it one of the most expensive paintings sold up to that date.  \nThis self-portrait of Picasso was painted in 1901, when he was a young man aged 19 who had recently arrived in Paris. The year was a significant point in the artist's career, as it was in the June of that year when Picasso's career as an artist was launched at his first exhibition at the gallery of Ambroise Vollard. In the spring of 1901, Picasso was a prolific artist, painting numerous canvases, which he produced in a studio in Montmartre. The year was also the beginning of his Blue Period, a phase characterised by melancholy, blue hues that dominated his artwork. This period was influenced by the suicide of Picasso's friend, the painter Carlos Casagemas, who had shot himself in the head in a Paris café in February 1901.\nYo, Picasso depicts the artist as he appeared in his youth. The painting is a brightly coloured, flamboyant portrait, reminiscent of Van Gogh, which depicts the artist wearing a white shirt and a bright orange cravate around his neck, set against a blue background. The title of the painting is derived from the inscription made by Picasso on the top left of the painting. It has been described as a \"a 19th-century swagger portrait\" by Charles Darwent for the Independent. The Irish Times has described the portrait as, \"a bohemian dandy with thick hair and an intense look\". Picasso looks directly at the viewer \"with supreme self-confidence\", illustrated by the inscription \"YO\" in large capital letters. This assertion has been described as \"defiant\" by the Evening Standard.Picasso’s YO challenges not only us but the great Raphael portrait of Castiglione in the Louvre; make the comparison, this YO demands, my crude immediate brushwork against Raphael’s delicacy, my jarring chromatic contrasts against his tone, my furious energy against his calm, the work of half an afternoon triumphant over the work of weeks of craft and contemplation. Even the palette is not logically laid out as we might expect, but stabbed with the short strokes of colour characteristic of a finished painting — particularly of La Nana, which may be its immediate contemporary. Picasso’s was a YO about to trample all conventions.On 22 May 1981, Paul Richard for The Washington Post described the painting as \"a confident, ferocious self-portrait\". \"Yo Picasso was one of the most popular self-portraits seen in the enormous Picasso retrospective last summer at the Museum of Modern Art. He had not yet entered his Blue Period, but could already paint with extraordinary power.\"\nIn November 1912 Hugo von Hofmannsthal purchased Yo, Picasso from the gallery of Heinrich Thannhauser in Munich. The painting was inherited by Hofmannsthal's daughter Christiane, who moved to New York in 1939 with her husband, the  Indologist Heinrich Zimmer. The painting remained in the family's possession until it was sold by their son, Michael Zimmer. \n Fletcher Jones purchased the painting at Christie's in London for £147,000 in 1970. In December 1975 his estate sold it at Christie's to \"an anonymous French buyer\" for £283,500. In May 1981, Wendell Cherry bought the painting at Sotheby's in New York for $5.3 million. In May 1989, he sold it at Sotheby's for $47.85 million to Greek billionaire Stavros Niarchos. This was the second highest price paid up to that date for a work of art sold at auction.\nIn 2013, it was exhibited at the Courtauld Gallery, \"Becoming Picasso: Paris 1901\".\nPicasso created many self-portraits throughout his life, many of which he kept in his possession and passed to his heirs. These self-portraits offer a wide variety of self-representations using different styles, including:\nSelf Portrait (Yo), 1901, oil on cardboard painting mounted on wood,  51.4 cm x 31.8 cm, MoMA.\nSelf-Portrait, 1907. oil on canvas, 56 cm x 46 cm. Národní galerie v Praze\nSelf-Portrait, oil on canvas, 56 cm x 45.3 cm, Private collection, Switzerland \nSelf-Portrait, Barcelona, 1899-1900, charcoal and chalk on paper, 22.5 cm x 26.5 cm\n"

    "painting_info": "Shot Marilyns is a series of silkscreen paintings produced in 1964 by Andy Warhol, each canvas measuring 40 inches square, and each a portrait of Marilyn Monroe.\nPop artist Andy Warhol had a fascination with Hollywood and fame. A legend of the silver screen, Marilyn Monroe is widely considered to be the epitome of Hollywood glamour. After her death at the age of 36 in August 1962, Warhol began immortalizing her in his work. \"In August '62 I started doing silkscreens.... It was all so simple-quick and chancy. I was thrilled with it. My first experiments with screens were heads of Troy Donahue and Warren Beatty, and then when Marilyn Monroe happened to die that month, I got the idea to make screens of her beautiful face — the first Marilyns.\"\nIn 1964, Warhol created portraits of Monroe based on a publicity photo for her 1953 film Niagara. He painted five Marilyn silkscreen portraits with different colored backgrounds: red, orange, light blue, sage blue, and turquoise, and stored them at The Factory, his studio on East 47th Street in Manhattan.\nDorothy Podber, a performance artist and friend of Factory photographer Billy Name, saw the recently completed paintings stacked against one another at the studio and asked Warhol if she could shoot them. Believing that she intended to photograph the paintings, Warhol agreed. Podber doffed her pair of black gloves, withdrew a small revolver from her purse, and fired a shot into the stack of four paintings, which became known as The Shot Marilyns. The fifth painting with the turquoise background was not in the stack.\nIn the 2002 documentary How to Draw a Bunny, Name described this event as a \"performance piece\" by Podber. After she had shot the paintings and left, Andy Warhol purportedly asked Name to please ask Podber not to do that again. She was, however, henceforth barred from The Factory for life.\nBlue Shot Marilyn was purchased by Peter Brant for $5,000 in 1967.\nShot Red Marilyn was sold to Masao Wanibuchi for $4.1 million at Christie's in 1989. In the midst of an art market recession, he sold it at a loss to Philip Niarchos for $3.6 million in 1994.\nOrange Marilyn was bought for $17.3 million by Si Newhouse in 1998. After his death, Kenneth C. Griffin purchased it for around $200 million in 2017.\nTurquoise Marilyn was bought by Steve Cohen in 2007 for a rumored $80 million.\nShot Sage Blue Marilyn was auctioned by Christie's in New York City on May 9, 2022. It sold for $195 million from the Foundation of Thomas and Doris Ammann. This sale greatly extended the record for a price paid at auction for a work by an American artist set by Jean-Michel Basquiat's 1982 painting Untitled, which sold for $110.5 million in 2017. It also set the mark for the most expensive work of 20th century art sold in a public sale.\nThe  purchaser was the American art dealer Larry Gagosian.  It has not been disclosed as of yet whether he was buying the work for himself or a secondary party.\n"

    "painting_info": "Portrait of Alfonso d'Avalos with a Page is a 1533 portrait by Titian of Alfonso d'Avalos, a general in the service of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. It has been in the Getty Museum in Los Angeles since 2004. After Venus and Adonis (1555-1560) and Penitent Magdalene (1555-1561), it was the third Titian work to enter the Getty collection.\nTitian produced the work in Bologna. It was inherited by the subject's son marquis Francesco Ferdinando d'Avalos (c. 1530–1571) and probably remained in the family for a time after this. It moved to Poland at an unknown date and was owned by Jan Sobieski and Stanislaus II. August Poniatowski. It was probably then donated to the Potocki family, who retained it until 1921, when Alfred Potocki sold it to countess Martine-Marie-Pol de Béhague (1870 – 1939). She left it and the rest of her collection to her nephew Hubert de Ganay.\nIn 1989 de Ganay's heirs auctioned off much of the collection at Sothebys in Monte Carlo and the following year the insurance company Axa acquired the Titian for 65 million francs. Axa lent the painting to the Louvre for twelve years, with the option to buy it for 65 million francs plus inflation, a preferential price.  The deal was arranged by the Louvre's director Pierre Rosenberg, but his successor Henri Loyrette let the twelve years expire, leaving the Getty to buy the work for $70 million. Since the painting was in private hands and the Réunion des Musées Nationaux had decided against purchasing it, the French state could not veto its sale outside of France.\n"

    "painting_info": "\nOrange, Red, Yellow is a 1961 Color Field painting by Mark Rothko. On May 8, 2012, it was sold at Christie's from the estate of David Pincus for $86,882,500, a record nominal price for post-war contemporary art at public auction.\nThe work was acquired by Marlborough Fine Art in London from the Marlborough-Gerson gallery in New York. Marlborough Fine Art sold the work to David Pincus in 1967. Pincus is regarded as one of the leading American collectors in the second half of the 20th century. The work has not been on the market in the 45 years since Pincus' acquisition. It has been exhibited on occasion. From February to March 1964, it was exhibited at the Marlborough New London Gallery in London in a Mark Rothko exhibition. From September to November 1986 it was exhibited by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, in its \"Philadelphia Collects: Art Since 1940\" exhibition. From June to December 1996 it was exhibited by the Palmer Museum of Art at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pennsylvania for their \"Abstraction to Figuration: Selections of Contemporary Art from the Pincus Collection\" exhibition. It was also later on extended loan at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\nThis surpassed the 2007 record price for a Rothko work of $72.8 million set when David Rockefeller sold White Center (Yellow, Pink and Lavender on Rose). The hammer price was $77.5 million, and the price was $86.8 million including buyer's premium. It established a new record for post-war/contemporary art at a public auction, when ignoring inflation. The highest price paid for a post-war painting in a private sale is believed to be $140 million (~$160 million in May 2012 dollars) for Jackson Pollock's No. 5, 1948 in November 2006. In constant dollars, the record price for post-war art at a public auction remained with Triptych, 1976 by Francis Bacon, sold at Sotheby's for $86.3 million in May 2008 (~$92 million in May 2012 dollars).\nThe price for Rothko's painting was expected to top out near $45 million based on presale estimates. When the record-setting 2012 auction price reached $70 million, three bidders remained competitive. The bidding extended for over six and a half minutes, which is \"...one of the longest bidding matches yet witnessed in a contemporary art sale.\"\nSouren Melikian of The New York Times described Rothko's Orange, Red, Yellow as one that \"...can convincingly be argued to be the most powerful of all his pictures\", Kelly Crow of The Wall Street Journal stated that \"The painting's trio of orange and yellow rectangles bobbing atop a cherry-red background forms a palette that's as eye-catching as a sunset or a Popsicle.\", noting that \"Auction specialists say collectors historically pay more for works that are red and gold, as opposed to gray.\"\n"

    "short_description": "Painting by Edward Hopper",
    "painting_info": "\nChop Suey (1929) is a painting by Edward Hopper. The foreground of the work portrays two women in conversation at a restaurant. In November 2018, it was sold at $92 million, a record price for the artist's work.\nThe scene depicts two women at a table in a restaurant with another couple in the background. The only features being shown in particular detail are the painted woman’s face, the coat hanging above her, her companion’s back , the features of the couple in the background, the tea pot on the table, the masked lower window panel, and the restaurant sign outside. These are all features that would bring a sensory element (besides sight) to the memory painted: the buzzing noise of the outside light, the voices of the people in the background, the texture of the coat, the taste of the tea and smell of the cigarette smoke (held by the man), and the muddled light from the masked window. \nEdward Hopper’s artwork is known for its realistic scenes that touch themes of isolation and self-being rather than a narrative context. He often described his art as a “transcription  most intimate impressions of nature” meaning he related the process of painting to that of memory. This idea could further be described in another way as when, for example, you draw something from a personal memory, certain details can be remembered but everything outside the primary focus is blank background. Chop Suey captures this concept of memory, making the viewer focus on particular elements of sensory iconography whilst depicting a theme of isolation due to self being.\nAccording to art scholar David Anfam, one \"striking detail of Chop Suey is that its female subject faces her doppelgänger.\" Others have pointed out it would not be so unusual for two women to be wearing similar hats, and that it is presumptuous to claim doppelgängers when one  subject's face is not visible to the viewer. The painting has an interior subject matter, being inside of a cafe, and does not focus on any one given figure. As with many of Hopper's works, the painting features close attention to the effects of light on his subjects.\nBy detailing only the sensory iconography, the painting takes a step back from pure realism, as if by painting the complete memory you are also destroying the fine details that make it actively realistic. Rolf G. Renner, author of “Hopper” states that, “…part of what  pictures are ‘about’ is that death or decay which all paintings in some sense represent, since they destroy the immediacy of perception through the transformation into an image”.\nAlthough the scene of the painting takes place in a social environment there is the sense of loneliness prevalent. The woman in green facing the viewer is sitting with her companion but she does not seem to be interacting with her. As with the couple in the background, the man looks withdrawn from the woman he sits across from. Every human figure is isolated and withdrawn from one another and reserved within themselves. This is portrayed with hidden or obscured faces, retracting a human essence from the figures. This further applies to the woman in detail; even though we get a full view of her face there is a detachment to her because of her stark makeup.\nThe alabaster skin with the bold rouge and painted lip suggest only the impression of a woman, similar to a doll, it only suggests the appearance of a girl. Normally in context with the style of the era (late 1920s), this could be taken as a trendy and lively style, “the women's tight-fitting sweaters, cloche hats, and made-up faces, which in a previous era would have marked them as sexually available, had become mainstream”. But Hopper negates that by making the woman’s face the same value of white as other blank features in the background, thus hollowing-out her human essence. The viewer interprets her to be “spacing out”or listening un-intently rather than making eye contact and interacting with the viewer, as if she is not focused on her surroundings.\nThe composition of Chop Suey further encompasses Hopper’s concept memory as opposed to complete realism. The balance is held across the middle section of the painting with there being more un-detailed areas just above the eye line of sight, these areas are marked with rougher brush marks. The negative/ un-detalied space in the background further add to this because the eye simply passes over them and focuses more on the details presented. These spaces are simple because they are the background features that were not committed to memory. There is “weight” held in the presence of details contained between the figures at the tables all the way to the details in the design of the sign outside, the hanging jacket and the lower window covering. This gives the effect of the viewer seeing the scene and all the important aspects, ignoring the exterior context.  This is described in an article by USA Today Magazine: “The brief interruption in action, the mask-like face of the protagonist, and the abstract geometries in the windows contribute to the sense that the unfolding narrative is not about these specific actions or this place, but rather about a modern state of being”.\nWith this in mind the viewer can assume the narrative behind this particular memory. In a bibliography by Gail Levin, the location of Chop Suey is described, “…the setting recalled the inexpensive, second floor Chinese restaurant the Hoppers had been frequenting in Columbus Circle”. This might explain the primary focus on the woman and the dullness of the surroundings. His wife Jo Hopper most likely modeled for the three female figures as would in his many paintings If it was a place Edward Hopper had frequently visited then there would be no reason to concentrate on the surroundings, but rather the moment of the scene.\nBarney A. Ebsworth owned the painting and had promised it to the Seattle Art Museum. However, at his death, ownership transferred to his estate. In November of 2018, the painting sold for $92 million, a new record for a work by the artist.\nA bumper played on the cable channel Turner Classic Movies, titled The Sunny Side of Life, was inspired by Chop Suey and other Hopper paintings.\n"

    "painting_info": "Rideau, Cruchon et Compotier (English: Curtain, Jug and Fruit Bowl) is an oil on canvas painting created circa 1893 to 1894 by French artist Paul Cézanne. It is a formal still life composition that displays Cézanne's exploration of form, balance and symmetry in objects. On 10 May 1999, the painting was sold at Sotheby's auction for $60.5 million, making it the most expensive still life painting ever sold at an auction.\nCézanne explored various genres throughout his artistic career, including landscapes and portraiture, but repeatedly returned to the subject of still life. It was a genre that historically had been disregarded in art as unimaginative, yet Cézanne challenged the establishment by focusing on everyday objects. He was particularly drawn to fruit, which he used to explore the correspondence between objects and the harmony and balance of composition. Although his objects appear to have been placed randomly, the images were carefully constructed to experiment with perspective.\nCézanne was fascinated by the exploration of optics in art. His still life paintings were a study in the geometric forms of objects and also in the shifting ways that our eyes view them. He attempted to depict objects from various perspectives to capture the complexity of the visual image. He wrote that, \"Painting from nature is not copying the object, it is realising one's sensations\".\nCézanne's distinctive brushwork and distortion of the subject eventually influenced new art styles during the 20th century such as Cubism.\nThis painting is a formal representation of its subject title, depicting a wooden table upon which are placed a large earthenware jug and a fruit bowl stacked with apples and oranges. To the left of the painting a curtain hangs in front of a patterned wall. A white cloth has been draped across the table with various fruits placed among its folds. The composition displays a study of outlines and a symmetry of objects. The earthenware jug has been depicted in a unique manner, in contradiction to ordinary perspective, and has been adapted to the shapes of the fruit and the other elements of the composition. The rich colours of the objects have been individually rendered with a full range of varying shades.\nThe painting was owned by Paul Gauguin and subsequently owned by Ambroise Vollard, Cornelis Hoogendijk, Paul Rosenberg, Albert C. Barnes, and the Carroll Carstairs Gallery. On 10 May 1999, the painting was sold at Sotheby's, New York City for $60,502,500 (equivalent to $90.1 million in 2020), a record price, during the sale of the Whitney family collection. Billionaire Ken Griffin purchased the painting to add to his private collection. The painting was later resold to Steve Wynn in August 1999 in a private sale for an undisclosed price.\nA second version of the work, painted by Cézanne in the same year under the same title, is in a private collection.\n"

    "short_description": "Large acrylic painting by David Hockney",
    "painting_info": "\n\nPortrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) is a large acrylic-on-canvas pop art painting by British artist David Hockney, completed in May 1972. It measures 7 ft × 10 ft (2.1 m × 3.0 m), and depicts two figures: one swimming underwater and one clothed male figure looking down at the swimmer. In November 2018, it sold for US$90.3 million, at that time the highest price ever paid at auction for a painting by a living artist.\nHockney visited California for the first time in January 1964 after a successful first solo exhibition at the John Kasmin gallery. The United States fascinated him, and Los Angeles in particular, partly because of the influence of Hollywood cinema but also because of the modernist building Case Study House #21. As a gay man, he was also a fan of the beefcake magazine Physique Pictorial, which was published in Los Angeles. \"I instinctively knew I was going to like it,\" Hockney said, \"and as I flew over San Bernardino and saw the swimming pools and the houses and everything and the sun, I was more thrilled than I have ever been in arriving in any city.\"\nHockney painted the first of his pool paintings, California Art Collector in 1964, and the swimming pool became a recurring theme in his paintings, such as Peter Getting Out of Nick's Pool (1966, Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) and most notably A Bigger Splash (1967, Tate Gallery).  He painted a series of double portraits from 1968 to 1977, including American Collectors (Fred and Marcia Weisman) (1968, Art Institute of Chicago), and Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy (1971, Tate Gallery).\nThis work brings together two of Hockney's themes from his paintings of the late 1960s and early 1970s: the swimming pool, and the double portrait.  It depicts a male figure in white trunks swimming breaststroke underwater, and the painter Peter Schlesinger, Hockney's former lover and muse, fully clothed and standing at the edge of the pool looking down at the swimmer. The painting is set in southern France, near Saint-Tropez. In characteristic Hockney style, the foreground is simplified and flattened with a view of tree-clad hills in the background.\nThe composition was inspired by a serendipitous combination of photographs that Hockney noticed on his studio floor: one of a man swimming underwater, taken in California in 1966, and the other of a man standing looking at the ground.  Juxtaposed, it appeared as if the standing person was looking at the swimmer. Hockney's relationship with Schlesinger had ended abruptly in 1971, following a fight in Cadaqués.  \"By showing another young man swimming towards Peter, the artist acknowledges lost love and his boyfriend’s desire for a new partner\".  The painting can be viewed as fitting into a European tradition since the Renaissance of depicting the nude bathing, washing off the stain of pollution amid the peace of nature.\nHockney worked on the painting for four months in late 1971, but dissatisfied with the composition, in particular with the angle of the pool, abandoned the work and started afresh. He then travelled for several months with Mark Lancaster, and returned to the work in early 1972. The year 1972 was a very productive year for Hockney, as he threw himself into his work to escape from his unhappiness, often working 14 or 15 hours a day.  Around the same time, he was working on his (unfinished) double portrait of George Lawson and Wayne Sleep (1972-5, Tate).\nIn April 1972, Hockney flew to the south of France to better visualise the figure swimming underwater, using the pool at film director Tony Richardson's villa at Le Nid du Duc near Saint-Tropez to do so. Hockney's studio assistant, Mo McDermott, recreated the pose of the downcast man, while a young photographer, John St Clair, was the swimmer. Hockney took hundreds of photographs based on his original composition. \nBack at his London studio, Hockney assembled the photos along with photographs of Peter Schlesinger taken in Kensington Gardens wearing the same pink jacket. Hockney worked on the painting for two weeks, working 18-hour days, completing and varnishing it only the night before it was due to be shipped to New York for the exhibition at André Emmerich Gallery. It was first shown in the exhibition Paintings and Drawings, which ran from 13 to 31 May 1972. \nHockney said of the painting, \"I must admit I loved working on that picture,  working with such intensity; it was marvellous doing it, really thrilling\"\nThe creation of the painting and the breakdown of Hockney's relationship with Schlesinger were featured in the semi-fictional 1974 documentary A Bigger Splash, named after the 1967 Hockney painting.\nThe painting was originally sold to James Astor and his wife in 1972 for $18,000 (equivalent to $117,000 in 2021). Six months later it was sold on for $50,000 (equivalent to $324,000 in 2021). It was acquired in 1983 by the American billionaire David Geffen, who sold it to British billionaire Joe Lewis in 1995 at an undisclosed price.\nIt was included in the Hockney exhibition, which toured the Tate Gallery, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Centre Georges Pompidou from February 2017 to February 2018.\nOn 15 November 2018, in nine minutes of bidding, it was sold to an unknown buyer for $90.3 million at Christie's auction house in New York City, setting an auction record for a living artist. The sale broke the previous record for a living artist of $58 million for Jeff Koons' Balloon Dog (Orange) in 2013 and more than tripled the record for a work by Hockney, $28.5 million for Pacific Coast Highway and Santa Monica set in May 2018.  The highest known prices for a painting by a living artist in private sales are for two paintings by Jasper Johns (born 1930): in 2006, Kenneth C. Griffin bought Johns' False Start for about $80 million ($108 million in 2021) from David Geffen, and in 2010 Steven A. Cohen bought Johns' 1958 Flag for around $110 million (equivalent to $137 million in 2021) from Leo Castelli's son.\n"

    "short_description": "Series of paintings by Vincent van Gogh",
    "painting_info": "Sunflowers (original title, in French: Tournesols) is the title of two series of still life paintings by the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh. The first series, executed in Paris in 1887, depicts the flowers lying on the ground, while the second set, made a year later in Arles, shows a bouquet of sunflowers in a vase. In the artist's mind, both sets were linked by the name of his friend Paul Gauguin, who acquired two of the Paris versions. About eight months later van Gogh hoped to welcome and impress Gauguin again with Sunflowers, now part of the painted Décoration for the Yellow House that he prepared for the guestroom of his home in Arles, where Gauguin was supposed to stay. After Gauguin's departure, van Gogh imagined the two major versions as wings of the Berceuse Triptych, and finally, he included them in his Les XX in Bruxelles exhibit.\nLittle is known of Van Gogh's activities during the two years he lived with his brother, Theo, in Paris, 1886–1888. The fact that he had painted Sunflowers already is only revealed in the spring of 1889, when Gauguin claimed one of the Arles versions in exchange for studies he had left behind after leaving Arles for Paris. Van Gogh was upset and replied that Gauguin had absolutely no right to make this request: \"I am definitely keeping my sunflowers in question. He has two of them already, let that hold him. And if he is not satisfied with the exchange he has made with me, he can take back his little Martinique canvas, and his self-portrait sent to me from Brittany, at the same time giving me back both my portrait and the two sunflower canvases which he has taken to Paris. So if he ever broaches this subject again, I've told you just how matters stand.\"\nThe two Sunflowers in question show two buttons each; one of them was preceded by a small study, and a fourth large canvas combines both compositions.\nThese were Van Gogh's first paintings with \"nothing but sunflowers\"—yet, he had already included sunflowers in still life and landscape earlier.\nIn a letter to Theo dating from 21 or 22 August 1888, Vincent wrote: \"I'm painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won’t surprise you when it's a question of painting large sunflowers.\" At this time he had three paintings on the go, and intended to do more; as he explained to his brother: \"in the hope of living in a studio of our own with Gauguin, I'd like to do a decoration for the studio. Nothing but large sunflowers\".\nLeaving aside the first two versions, all Arlesian Sunflowers are painted on size 30 canvases.\nThe versions of the paintings provided by van Gogh in his announcement of his sunflower series do not precisely match every detail supplied by him. The first version differs in size, is painted on a size 20 canvas—not on a size 15 canvas as indicated—and all the others differ in the number of flowers depicted from van Gogh's announcement. The second was evidently enlarged and the initial composition altered by insertion of the two flowers lying in the foreground, center and right. Neither the third nor the fourth shows the dozen or 14 flowers indicated by the artist, but more—fifteen or sixteen.\nThese alterations are executed wet-in-wet and therefore considered genuine rework—even the more so as they are copied to the repetitions of January 1889; there is no longer a trace of later alterations, at least in this aspect\nThe fourth version of the painting was attacked on October 14, 2022 by environmental activists from the Just Stop Oil campaign, who threw tomato soup at it, while it was on display at National Gallery in London, before gluing their hands to the wall. The painting was covered with plexiglass, and it was unharmed with the exception of minor damage to the frame. The two activists were arrested and the painting was put back on display later that day.\nSunflowers (F453), first version: turquoise backgroundOil on canvas, 73.5 × 60 cmPrivate collection\nSunflowers (F454), fourth version: yellow backgroundOil on canvas, 92.1 × 73 cmNational Gallery, London, England\nSunflowers (F456), third version: blue green backgroundOil on canvas, 91 × 72 cmNeue Pinakothek, Munich, Germany\nSunflowers (F459), second version: royal-blue backgroundOil on canvas, 98 × 69 cmFormerly private collection, Ashiya, Japan, destroyed by US air raid of World War II on 6 August 1945\nSunflowers (F455), repetition of the 3rd versionOil on canvas, 92 × 72.5 cmPhiladelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, United States.\nSunflowers (F458), repetition of the 4th version (yellow background)Oil on canvas, 95 × 73 cmVan Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, Netherlands.\nSunflowers (F457), replica of the 4th version (yellow green background)Oil on canvas, 100 × 76 cmSompo Japan Museum of Art, Tokyo, Japan.\nBoth repetitions of the 4th version are no longer in their original state. In the Amsterdam version, a strip of wood was added at the top—probably by van Gogh himself. The Tokyo version, however, was enlarged on all sides with strips of canvas, which were added at a later time—presumably by the first owner, Émile Schuffenecker. The series is perhaps van Gogh's best known and most widely reproduced. In the 2000s debate arose regarding the authenticity of one of the paintings, and it has been suggested that this version may have been the work of Émile Schuffenecker or of Paul Gauguin. Most experts, however, conclude that the work is genuine.\nIn January 1889, when Vincent had just finished the first repetitions of the Berceuse and the Sunflowers pendants, he told Theo: \"I picture to myself these same canvases between those of the sunflowers, which would thus form torches or candelabra beside them, the same size, and so the whole would be composed of seven or nine canvases.\"\nA definite hint for the arrangement of the triptych is supplied by Van Gogh's sketch in a letter of July 1889.\nLater that year, Vincent selected both versions for his display at Les XX, 1890.\nVan Gogh began painting in late summer of 1888 and continued into the following year. One went to decorate his friend Paul Gauguin's bedroom. The paintings show sunflowers in all stages of life, from full bloom to withering. The paintings were considered innovative for their use of the yellow spectrum, partly because newly invented pigments made new colours possible.\n\nIn a letter to Theo, Vincent wrote: \"It's a type of painting that changes its aspect a little, which grows in richness the more you look at it. Besides, you know that Gauguin likes them extraordinarily. He said to me about them, among other things:\n‘that — ... that's... the flower’. You know that Jeannin has the peony, Quost has the hollyhock, but I have the sunflower, in a way.\"On March 30, 1987, Japanese insurance magnate Yasuo Goto paid the equivalent of US$39,921,750 for van Gogh's Still Life: Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers at auction at Christie's London, at the time a record-setting amount for a work of art. The price was over three times the previous record of about $12 million paid for Andrea Mantegna's Adoration of the Magi in 1985. The record was broken a few months later with the purchase of another Van Gogh, Irises, by Alan Bond for $53.9 million at Sotheby's, New York on November 11, 1987.\nWhile it is uncertain whether Yasuo Goto bought the painting himself or on behalf of his company, the Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Company of Japan, the painting currently resides at Seiji Togo Yasuda Memorial Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo. After the purchase, a controversy arose whether this is a genuine van Gogh or an Émile Schuffenecker forgery.\nTwo Paris versions van Gogh exchanged with Gauguin in December 1887 or January 1888, were both sold to Ambroise Vollard: one in January 1895 and the other in April 1896.  The first canvas resided for a short time with Félix Roux, but was reacquired by Vollard and sold to Degas, then from his estate to Rosenberg, then to Hahnloser and bequested to the Kunstmuseum Bern. The second was acquired by the Dutch collector Hoogendijk at the sale of his collection by Kann, who ceded the painting to Richard Bühler and then via Thannhauser to the Metropolitan Museum in New York.\nTwo of van Gogh's Sunflowers paintings never left the artist's estate: the study for one of the Paris versions (F377) and the repetition of fourth version (F458). Both are in the possession of the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, established 1962 by Vincent Willem van Gogh, the artist's nephew, and on permanent loan to the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam.\nFive other versions are recorded in the Van Gogh estate papers:\nTwo Arles versions left the artist's estate unrecorded:\n"

On May 16, 2007 at 7 P.M, it sold for $71.7m (£42.3m) at auction.\nGreen Car Crash (Green Burning Car I) is one of the representative paintings of the Pop Culture. It is a part of the Death and Disaster series painted by Andy Warhol in 1963. The painting is attributed to Warhol himself, but it is assumed that his assistant Gerard Malanga had a large contribution to this creation. Green Car Crash is one of the highly valued paintings of this collection. Green Car Crash was finished in 1963. It was inspired by photographs taken by John Whitehead and published in Newsweek magazine. The car was pursued by the Seattle police. The driver lost control of the wheel at 60 miles per hour (97 km/h), crashing into a utility pole. Green Car Crash (Green Burning Car I) is the only Warhol Burning Car painting of five (all based on Whitehead's photograph) to utilize a color other than black and white.\nGreen Car Crash was privately owned for more than 30 years, and when it was put up for sale in 2007, it generated a large amount of interest. By that time, it set a new record for an Andy Warhol creation, being sold for $71.7 million, while the pre-auction estimate was $25 million.\nThe record was broken in 2013, when another painting of the collection, the Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster) was sold for $105.4 million.\n"

    "painting_info": "In This Case is a painting created by American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat in 1983. The artwork, which depicts a skull, is among the most expensive paintings ever purchased. In May 2021, it sold for $93.1 million at Christie's New York, the second highest auction record by Basquiat.\nBy the time Jean-Michel Basquiat executed In This Case at the age of 22 in 1983, he was already internationally acclaimed for his neo-expressionism paintings. The six-by-six-foot work on canvas depicts a \"large skull head set against a ruby-red background, with a blazing eye, protruding green teeth, and fractured anatomy.\" Art historian Robert Farris Thompson described the work as \"one of Basquiat’s strongest...a climactic portrait of the black face that haunts painting after painting. Every creative touch—the green teeth, the yellow eye, the navy-blue skin—is exactly right.\" Depictions of Human anatomy are prevalent throughout Basquiat's oeuvre, rooting from his childhood when his mother gave him a copy of Gray's Anatomy while he recuperated from a car accident. \"What drew Basquiat almost obsessively to the depiction of the human head was his fascination with the face as a passageway from exterior physical presence into the hidden realities of man’s psychological and mental realms,\" wrote Art historian Fred Hoffman.\nIn This Case is the last in a series of large skull paintings made between 1981 and 1983. The first, Untitled (Skull) (1981) was acquired by Eli and Edythe Broad the year after it was painted and is now housed at The Broad museum in Los Angeles. The second, Untitled (1982) was sold for $110.5 million at Sotheby's in 2017, the highest price paid for an American artist at auction. In 2018, a Basquiat retrospective opened at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris featuring the trinity of skull paintings. \"What situates these canvases among his most arresting is the violence they bring to their upending of the vanitas. Listed Untitled, the first two are sometimes dubbed Skull, while the third is titled In This Case; these cranial anatomies are not memento mori, but amplified memories played very, very loud. So loud that their presence is indisputable,\" explained co-curator, Olivier Michelon.\nIn May 2021, In This Case was sold at Christie's 21st-century art auction for $93.1 million, which far exceeded the pre-sale estimate of $50 million. The seller was Italian businessman Giancarlo Giammetti, co-founder of the fashion house Valentino. The work of art was photographed in the dining room of his Manhattan apartment for a 2013 Architectural Digest spread. Giammetti purchased the painting from Gagosian in 2007, which was previously sold for $999,500 at Sotheby's in 2002.\nIn This Case has been exhibited at the following art institutions:\n"

    "short_description": "Painting by Sandro Botticelli",
    "painting_info": "The Portrait of a Young Man Holding a Roundel (also known as Portrait of a Young Man holding a Trecento Medallion) is a painting attributed to Sandro Botticelli. Due to its style it has been estimated to have been painted around 1480. The identity of the portrait's subject is unknown, but analysts suggest it could be someone from the Medici family, as Lorenzo de' Medici was one of Botticelli's main benefactors. \nThe painting, thought to have been completed c. 1480, is believed to represent the beauty ideals of  Renaissance Florentine high society. The young man's tunic is of a simple, fine quality with a blue color very rare at the time. The work was painted in tempera on poplar wood with a width of 38.9  cm and a height of 58.7  cm. The figure of the bearded saint in the trecento medallion was added after the portrait was completed and is believed to be an original by Bartolomeo Bulgarini, also known as the \"Ovile Master\". The medallion is very similar to other works by Bulgarini with a presumption that it was originally trimmed from a rectangular trecento. The young man is portrayed in front of a window frame in which the artist has fashioned a series of color planes. The inner frame is a uniform grey color, and appears to have a bright blueish tone to the left with a darker grey one in the right so the colors seem to change from left to right. One of the young man's fingers, supporting the medallion from below, rests on a bright grey strip at the bottom of the painting.  The hand acts as a repoussoir that provides the illusion that the medallion is in another level within the painting.   \nThe first modern record of the painting was in 1938, when it was owned by Baron Newborough of Caernarvon. At the time, the art dealer Frank Sabin visited the Newborough estate and appraised the painting's value. Lord Newborough was ignorant of the true value of the painting, so Sabin managed to buy the piece for a relatively low price. Art historians assumed that the painting came into the possession of the Newborough family when the 1st Baron Newborough, Thomas Winn, lived in Florence, Italy between 1782 and 1791. \nSabin sold the portrait to the collector Sir Thomas Merton in 1941 for a five-figure sum. During Merton's ownership the portrait was first described as a work by Botticelli. The attribution to Botticelli was doubted later, as prominent monographs on Botticelli did not include the portrait as one of his. Currently a majority of the art historians accept the attribution to Botticelli. While the Merton family owned the portrait, it became the subject of a poster for a Royal Academy of Arts Exhibition of Italian Art in 1960. In 1982, Merton's descendants sold the painting for £ 810,000 at an auction at Christie's.  \nAfter Sheldon Solow bought the piece in 1982, the portrait was loaned to major museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the National Gallery in London, and the Städel Museum in Frankfurt, where it was displayed in a Botticelli exhibition in 2009–2010. In January 2021, the portrait was sold at an auction at Sotheby's New York for more than US$92.2 million to a Russian-speaking collector. The price for the painting was the highest paid for a Botticelli and the highest for an Old Master work since Leonardo Da Vinci's Salvator Mundi sold in 2017.\n"

    "short_description": "1890–91 Series of paintings by Claude Monet",
    "painting_info": "\nHaystacks is the common English title for a series of impressionist paintings by Claude Monet. The principal subject of each painting in the series is stacks of harvested wheat (or possibly barley or oats: the original French title, Les Meules à Giverny, simply means The Stacks at Giverny). The title refers primarily to a twenty-five canvas series (Wildenstein Index Numbers 1266–1290) which Monet began near the end of the summer of 1890 and continued through the following spring, though Monet also produced five earlier paintings using this same stack subject.\nThe series is famous for the way in which Monet repeated the same subject to show the differing light and atmosphere at different times of day, across the seasons and in many types of weather.\nThe series is among Monet's most notable work. The largest Haystacks collections are held at the Musée d'Orsay and Musée Marmottan Monet in Paris, and in the Art Institute of Chicago. Other collections include the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Metropolitan Museum and Museum of Modern Art in New York, the National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo,  and the Musée de l'Orangerie in Paris. The Art Institute of Chicago collection includes six of the twenty-five Haystacks. \nOther museums that hold parts of this series include the Getty Center in Los Angeles, the Hill-Stead Museum in Farmington, Connecticut (which also has one of five from the earlier 1888–89 harvest), the Scottish National Gallery, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Kunsthaus Zürich, Tel Aviv Museum of Art and the Shelburne Museum,  Vermont. Private collections hold the remaining Haystacks paintings.\nMonet settled in Giverny in 1883. Most of his paintings from 1883 until his death 40 years later were of scenes within 3 kilometres (2 mi) of his home and gardens. Monet was intensely aware of and fascinated by the visual nuances of the region’s landscape and by the endless variations in the days and in the seasons—the stacks were just outside his door.\nMonet had previously painted a single subject in different light and different moods. However, as he matured as a painter, his depictions of atmospheric influences were increasingly concerned not only with specific effects but with the overall color harmonies that allowed him an autonomous use of rich color. The conventional wisdom was that the stacks were a simple subject but also an unimaginative one. However, contemporary writers and friends of the artist noted that Monet's subject matter was always carefully chosen, the product of careful thought and analysis.  Monet undertook to capture the stacks in direct light and then to re-examine them from the same view-point in different, often more muted, light and atmospheric conditions. It was then not unusual for Monet, in search of harmonious transitions within the series, to alter the canvases back in his studio.\nThe stacks depicted in the series are commonly referred to in English as hay, wheat or grain-stacks. In reality they stored sheafs of grain primarily for bread—so wheat —and not hay, an animal food. The 10-to-20-foot (3.0 to 6.1 m) stacks were a way of keeping the sheafs dry until the grain could be separated from the stalks by threshing. The local method of storing and drying unthreshed-grains was to use straw, or sometimes hay, as a thatched 'roof' for the stack, shielding the wheat, barley or oats from the elements until, once dry-enough, they could be threshed. The threshing machines then traveled from village to village. Thus, although the grain was harvested and the stacks were built by July, it often took until the following spring or even later—so through all the light and atmosphere changes of summer, autumn, winter and spring—for all the stacks to be reached by the threshing-machines. Grain storage/drying-stacks like these became common throughout Europe in the 19th century and survived until the inception of combine harvesters. The shapes of stacks were regional: in Normandy, where Giverny is situated, it was common for them to be round with quite steeply-pitched thatched 'roofs'—just as Monet painted.\nThe stacks belonged to Monet's farmer-neighbour, Monsieur Quéruel. Noticing the way the light changed on M. Quéruel's stacks, Monet asked his stepdaughter, Blanche Hoschedé, to bring him two canvases, one for sunny and one for overcast conditions. But Monet soon found he could not catch the ever-changing light and mood on merely two canvases: as a result, his willing helper was quickly bringing as many canvases as her wheelbarrow could hold. Monet's daily routine therefore came to involve carting paints, easels and many unfinished canvases back and forth, working on whichever canvas most closely resembled the scene of the moment as the conditions and light fluctuated. Although he began painting the stacks en plein air, Monet later revised his initial impressions in his studio, both to generate contrast and to preserve the harmony within the series.\nMonet produced numerous Haystacks paintings. He painted five paintings (Wildenstein Index Numbers 1213–1217) with stacks as his primary subject during the 1888 harvest. His earlier landscapes (Wildenstein Index Number 900–995, 1073) had included stacks  in an ancillary manner. The general consensus is that only the canvases produced using the 1890 harvest (Wildenstein Index Number 1266–1290) comprise the Haystacks series proper. However some commentators include additional paintings when referencing this series. For example, the Hill-Stead Museum talk of their two stack paintings even though one is from the 'proper' 1890 harvest, the other from the 1888 harvest. \nMonet's Haystacks series is one of his earliest to rely on repetition to illustrate nuances in his perception across natural variations such as times of day, seasons, and types of weather.  For Monet, the concept of producing and exhibiting a series of paintings related by subject and vantage point began in 1889, with at least ten paintings done at the Valley of the Creuse, and subsequently shown at the Galerie Georges Petit. This interest in the serial motif would continue for the rest of his career.\nAlthough the mundane subject was constant throughout the Haystack series, the underlying theme may be seen as the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception as the time of day, the seasons and the weather changed. The almost unvarying subject provided the basis for him to compare changes of light and mood across his nuanced series. The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.\nBeginning in the 1880s and 1890s, Monet focused on Haystacks and a number of other subjects (other series included the Mornings on the Seine, Poplars, Rouen Cathedral, the Houses of Parliament, and the Water Lilies, among others). In order to work on many paintings virtually simultaneously, he would awake before dawn so as to begin at the earliest time of day:\n... for the Early Mornings on the Seine series, he chose to paint at and before dawn, which made it 'an easier subject and simpler lighting than usual', because at this time of day the effects did not change so rapidly; however, this involved him getting up at 3:30 a.m., which seems to have been unprecedented even for so inveterate an early riser as Monet.\"As the morning progressed and the light changed he would switch to sequentially later canvas settings, sometimes working on as many as ten or twelve paintings a day, each one depicting a slightly different aspect of light. The process would be repeated over the course of days, weeks, or months, depending on the weather and the progress of the paintings until they were completed. As the seasons changed the process was renewed.\nCertain effects of light only last for a few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera received attention for no more than a few minutes a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.\n\nMany notable painters have been influenced by this particular series, including Les Fauves, Derain, and Vlaminck. Kandinsky's memoirs refer to the series: “What suddenly became clear to me was the unsuspected power of the palette, which I had not understood before and which surpassed my wildest dreams.” The Haystacks series was a financial success. Fifteen of these were exhibited by Durand-Ruel in May 1891, and most of the paintings were sold within a month. They were especially popular among collectors from America, with twenty out of the thirty Haystacks created landing in American collections. Of the American collectors, Bertha Honoré Palmer bought nine of Monet's Haystacks. The 1891 exhibit met with great public acclaim. Octave Mirbeau described Monet's daring series as representing \"what lies beyond progress itself.\" Others described the stacks as \"faces of the landscape\"—they represented the countryside as a retreat from daily problems and home for contentment with nature. Camille Pissarro said: \"These canvases breathe contentment.\" Most of the paintings sold immediately for as much as 1,000 francs. Additionally, Monet’s prices, in general, began to rise steeply. As a result, he was able to buy outright the house and grounds at Giverny and to start constructing a waterlily pond. After years of mere subsistence living, he was able to enjoy success.\nThe series demonstrates his intense study of light and atmospheric conditions and Monet was a perfectionist in his renderings. Monet destroyed more than one series of paintings that he found wanting. However, this series escaped his own harsh self-criticism and destruction.\nFrom the 1888 harvest, Monet produced three canvases featuring two stacks each (Wildenstein #'s 1213–5) against the backdrop of hills along the left bank of the Seine and a few Giverny houses to the right. Then, he turned to his left to capture two scenes (1216–7) in which the hills are shrouded by a line of poplars.\nGrainstacks at Giverny, sunset, 1888–89.

The buyer of the work was Hasso Plattner. Since September 2020, the painting is on display at the Museum Barberini in Potsdam.\nClimate activists threw mashed potatoes at the painting in October 2022, but it was not damaged and was cleaned and put back on display. \nStacks, End of Summer,  (Meules, fin de l'été), 1891.

Completed in 1526 in Basel, the work shows the Bürgermeister of Basel Jakob Meyer zum Hasen, his first wife (who had died earlier), his current wife, and his daughter grouped around the Madonna and infant Jesus.\nThe meaning of the two other male figures on the left side (the Madonna's right) is, like the overall iconography of the image, not entirely clear. Franny Moyle writes that the man on the Madonna's right is Meyer, and \"he boy and baby may be a presentation of Meyer's two deceased sons....\" The image testified to the resolutely Catholic faith of the Bürgermeister, who actively opposed the Reformation.\nHolbein's Darmstadt Madonna was influenced by Italian Renaissance religious painting; Franny Moyle writes that it was influenced by Andrea Mantegna's 1496 Madonna della Vittoria, and that the two paintings' \"perspectival approach ... is almost identical.\" The Darmstadt Madonna may also contain elements of Netherlandish portrait painting.\nEarlier located in Darmstadt, hence its title, the work was on loan to the Städelschen Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt am Main from 2004 to 2011.\nIn 2012, the painting was put on display in the Johanniterkirche in Schwäbisch Hall as part of the permanent exhibition of the Old Masters in the Würth Collection.\nAll of the following texts are in German:\n"

    "short_description": "Series of paintings by Vincent van Gogh",
    "painting_info": "Wheat Fields is a series of dozens of paintings by Dutch Post-Impressionist artist Vincent van Gogh, borne out of his religious studies and sermons, connection to nature, appreciation of manual laborers and desire to provide a means of offering comfort to others.  The wheat field works demonstrate his progression as an artist from the drab Wheat Sheaves made in 1885 in the Netherlands to the colorful and dramatic 1888–1890 paintings from Arles, Saint-Rémy and Auvers-sur-Oise in rural France.\nFailing to find a vocation in ministry, Van Gogh turned to art as a means to express and communicate his deepest sense of the meaning of life.  Cliff Edwards, author of Van Gogh and God: A Creative Spiritual Quest wrote:  \"Vincent's life was a quest for unification, a search for how to integrate the ideas of religion, art, literature, and nature that motivated him.\"\nVan Gogh came to view painting as a calling, \"I feel a certain indebtedness  and ... out of gratitude, want to leave some souvenir in the shape of drawings or pictures – not made to please a certain taste in art, but to express a sincere feeling.\" When Van Gogh left Paris for Arles, he sought an antidote to the ills of city life and work among laborers in the field \"giving his art and life the value he recognized in rural toil.\"\nIn the series of paintings about wheat fields, Van Gogh expresses through symbolism and use of color his deeply felt spiritual beliefs, appreciation of manual laborers and connection to nature.\nAs a young man Van Gogh pursued what he saw as a religious calling, wanting to minister to working people.  In 1876 he was assigned a post in Isleworth, England to teach Bible classes and occasionally preach in the Methodist church.\nWhen he returned to the Netherlands he studied for the ministry and also for lay ministry or missionary work without finishing either field of study.  With support from his father, Van Gogh went to Borinage in southern Belgium where he nursed and ministered to coal miners.  There he obtained a six-month trial position for a small salary where he preached in an old dance hall and established and taught Bible school. His self-imposed zeal and asceticism cost him the position.\nAfter a nine-month period of withdrawal from society and family; he rejected the church establishment, yet found his personal vision of spirituality, \"The best way to know God is to love many things.  Love a friend, a wife, something – whatever you like – (and) you will be on the way to knowing more about Him; this is what I say to myself. But one must love with a lofty and serious intimate sympathy, with strength, with intelligence.\"  By 1879, he made a shift in the direction of his life and found he could express his \"love of God and man\" through painting.\nDrawn to Biblical parables, Van Gogh found wheat fields metaphors for humanity's cycles of life, as both celebration of growth and realization of the susceptibility of nature's powerful forces.\nThe \"peasant genre\" that greatly influenced Van Gogh began in the 1840s with the works of Jean-François Millet, Jules Breton, and others. In 1885 Van Gogh described the painting of peasants as the most essential contribution to modern art. He described the works of Millet and Breton of religious significance, \"something on high,\" and described them as the \"voices of the wheat.\"\nThroughout Van Gogh's adulthood he had an interest in serving others, especially manual workers.  As a young man he served and ministered to coal miners in Borinage, Belgium which seemed to bring him close to his calling of being a missionary or minister to workers.\nA common denominator in his favored authors and artists was sentimental treatment of the destitute and downtrodden.  Referring to painting of peasants Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo: \"How shall I ever manage to paint what I love so much?\"  He held laborers up to a high standard of how dedicatedly he should approach painting, \"One must undertake with confidence, with a certain assurance that one is doing a reasonable thing, like the farmer who drives his plow... (one who) drags the harrow behind himself.  If one hasn't a horse, one is one's own horse.\"\nVan Gogh used nature for inspiration, preferring that to abstract studies from imagination.  He wrote that rather than making abstract studies: \"I am getting well acquainted with nature.  I exaggerate, sometime I make change in motif; but for all that, I do not invent the whole picture; on the contrary, I find it already in nature, only it must be disentangled.\"\nThe close association of peasants and the cycles of nature particularly interested Van Gogh, such as the sowing of seeds, harvest and sheaves of wheat in the fields. Van Gogh saw plowing, sowing and harvesting symbolic to man's efforts to overwhelm the cycles of nature: \"the sower and the wheat sheaf stood for eternity, and the reaper and his scythe for irrevocable death.\" The dark hours conducive to germination and regeneration are depicted in The Sower and wheat fields at sunset.\nIn 1889 Van Gogh wrote of the way in which wheat was symbolic to him: \"What can a person do when he thinks of all the things he cannot understand, but look at the fields of wheat... We, who live by bread, are we not ourselves very much like wheat... to be reaped when we are ripe.\"\nVan Gogh saw in his paintings of wheat fields an opportunity for people to find a sense of calm and meaning, offering more to suffering people than guessing at what they may learn \"on the other side of life.\"\nVan Gogh writes Theo that he hopes that his family brings to him \"what nature, clods of earth, the grass, yellow wheat, the peasant, are for me, in other words, that you find in your love for people something not only to work for, but to comfort and restore you when there is a need.\" Further exploring the connection between man and nature, Van Gogh wrote his sister Wil, \"What the germinating force is in a grain of wheat, love is in us.\"\nAt times Van Gogh was so enamored with nature that his sense of self seemed lost in the intensity of his work: \"I have a terrible lucidity at moments, these days when nature is so beautiful, I am not conscious of myself any more, and the picture comes to me as in a dream.\"\nWheat fields provided a subject in which Van Gogh could experiment with color. Tired of his work in the Netherlands made with dull, gray colors, van Gogh sought to create work that was more creative and colorful. In Paris Van Gogh met leading French artists Edgar Degas, Georges Seurat and others who provided illuminating influences on the use of color and technique.  His work, previously somber and dark, now \"blazed with color.\" His use of color was so dramatic that Van Gogh was sometimes called an Expressionist.\nWhile Van Gogh learned much about color and technique in Paris, southern France provided an opportunity to express his \"surging emotions.\" Enlightened by the effects of the sun drenched countryside in southern France, Van Gogh reported that above all, his work \"promises color.\"  This is where he began development of his masterpieces.\nVan Gogh used complementary, contrasting colors to bring an intensity to his work, which evolved over the periods of his work.  Two complementary colors of the same degree of vividness and contrast.\" Van Gogh mentioned the liveliness and interplay of \"a wedding of two complementary colors, their mingling and opposition, the mysterious vibrations of two kindred souls.\" An example of use of complementary colors is The Sower where gold is contrasted to purple and blue with orange to intensify the impact of the work.\nThe four seasons were reflected in lime green and silver of spring, yellow when the wheat matured, beige and then burnished gold.\nPrior to Van Gogh's exploration of southern France, there were just a few of his paintings where wheat was the subject.\nThe first, Sheaves of Wheat in a Field was painted July–August 1885 in Nuenen, Netherlands. Here the emphasis is on the land and labor is suggested by the \"bulging wheat stacks.\" This work was made several months after The Potato Eaters at a time when he was looking to free himself physically, emotionally and artistically from the gray colors of his art and life, moving away from Nuenen to develop, as author Albert Lubin describes, a more \"imaginative, colorful art that suited him much better.\"\nVan Gogh, who \"particularly admired a poem written by Walt Whitman about the beauty in a blade of grass\", began painting waving stalks of wheat in Paris. In 1887, he made Wheat Field with a Lark where Impressionist influences are reflected in his use of color and management of light and shadow. Brush strokes are made to reflect the objects, like the stalks of wheat. The work reflects the motion of the wheat blowing in the wind, the lark flying and the clouds streaking from the currents in the sky.  The cycles of life are reflected in the land left by harvested wheat and the growing wheat subject to the forces of the wind, as we are subject to the pressures in our lives.  The cycle of life depicted here is both tragic and comforting.  The stubble of the harvested wheat reflect the inevitable cycle of death, while the stalks of wheat, flying bird and windswept clouds reflect continual change.  Edge of a Wheat Field with Poppies, shown below, was also painted in 1887.\nSheaves of Wheat in a Field, July–August 1885, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands (F193)\nWheat Field with a Lark, 1887,  at Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, Netherlands (F310)\nEdge of a Wheatfield with Poppies, 1887, Private collection (drawing of painting) (F310a)\nVan Gogh was about 35 years of age when he moved to Arles in southern France.  There he was at the height of his career, producing some of his best work. His paintings represented different aspects of ordinary life, such as Harvest at La Crau.  The sunflower paintings, some of the most recognizable of Van Gogh's paintings, were created in this time.  He worked continuously to keep up with his ideas for paintings.  This is likely one of Van Gogh's happier periods of life.  He is confident, clear-minded and seemingly content.\nIn a letter to his brother, Theo, he wrote, \"Painting as it is now, promises to become more subtle – more like music and less like sculpture – and above all, it promises color.\" As a means of explanation, Van Gogh explains that being like music means being comforting.\nA prolific time, in less than 444 days van Gogh made about 100 drawings and produced more than 200 paintings.  Yet, he still found time and energy to write more than 200 letters.  While he painted quickly, mindful of the pace farmers would need to work in the hot sun, he spent time thinking about his paintings long before he put brush to canvas.\nHis work during this period represents a culmination of influences, such as Impressionism, Neo-Impressionism and Japanese art (see Japonism).  His style evolved into one with vivid colors and energetic, impasto brush strokes.\nBoth Farmhouse in a Wheat Field and Farmhouses in Wheat Field Near Arles were made in May, 1888 which Van Gogh described at the time: \"A little town surrounded by fields completely blooming with yellow and purple flowers; you know, it is a beautiful Japanese dream.\"\nFarmhouse in a Wheat Field, May 1888, reportedly at Van Gogh Museum (F408)\nFarmhouses in Wheat Field Near Arles, 1888, likely at P. and N. de Boer Foundation or Van Gogh Museum, both of which are in Amsterdam, Netherlands (F576)\nThe audience is drawn into the painting by the glowing disk of the rising Sun in citron-yellow which Van Gogh intended to represent the divine, replicating the nimbus from Eugène Delacroix's Christ Asleep during the Tempest.  Van Gogh depicts the cycle of life in the sowing of wheat against the field of mature wheat,  there is death, like the setting Sun, but also rebirth. The Sun will rise again.  Wheat has been cut, but the sower plants seeds for a new crop. Leaves have fallen from the tree in the distance, but leaves will grow again.\nIn The Sower, Van Gogh uses complementary colors to bring intensity to the picture. Blue and orange flecks in the plowed field and violet and gold in the spring wheat behind the sower. Van Gogh used colors symbolically and for effect, when speaking of the colors in this work he said: I couldn't care less what the colours are in reality.\nInspired by Jean-François Millet van Gogh made several paintings after The Sower by Millet. Van Gogh made seven other \"Sower\" paintings, one in 1883 and the other six after this work.\nDuring the last half of June he worked on a group of ten \"Harvest\" paintings, which allowed him to experiment with color and technique. \"I have now spent a week working hard in the wheatfields, under the blazing sun,\" Van Gogh wrote on 21 June 1888 to his brother Theo. He described the series of wheat fields as \"…landscapes, yellow—old gold—done quickly, quickly, quickly, and in a hurry just like the harvester who is silent under the blazing sun, intent only on the reaping.\"\nWheat Fields also Wheat Fields with the Alpilles Foothills in the Background is a view of the vast, spreading plain against a low horizon. Nearly the entire canvas is filled with the wheat field.  In the foreground is green wheat of yellow, green, red, brown and black colors, which sets off the more mature, golden yellow wheat.  The Alpilles range is just visible in the distance.\nVan Gogh wrote about Sunset: Wheat Fields Near Arles:  \"A summer sun... town purple, celestial body yellow, sky green-blue.  The wheat has all the hues of old gold, copper, green-gold or red-gold, yellow gold, yellow bronze, red-green.\"  He made this work during the height of the mistral winds.  To prevent his canvas from flying away, van Gogh drove the easel into the ground and secured the canvas to the easel with rope.\nArles: View from the Wheat Fields (Wheat Field with Sheaves and Arles in the Background),  another painting of this series, represents the harvest.  In the foreground are sheaves of harvested wheat leaning against one another.  The center of the painting depicts the harvesting process.\nWheat Field also Wheat Field with Alpilles Foothills in the Background, June 1888, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, Netherlands (F411)\nSunset: Wheat Fields Near Arles, June 1888, Kunstmuseum Winterthur, Switzerland (F465)\nArles: View from the Wheat Fields (Wheat Field with Sheaves and Arles in the Background), June 1888, Musée Rodin, Paris, France (F545)\nWheat Stacks with Reaper was made in June, 1888 (as indicated by the F number sequence) or June 1890 in Auvers as noted by the Toledo Museum of Art, where it resides.  Of the figure \"the reaper\" Van Gogh expressed his symbolic, spiritual view of those who worked close to nature in a letter to his sister in 1889:  \"aren’t we, who live on bread, to a considerable extent like wheat, at least aren't we forced to submit to growing like a plant without the power to move, by which I mean in whatever way our imagination impels us, and to being reaped when we are ripe, like the same wheat?\"\nHarvest in Provence is a particularly relaxed version of the harvest paintings. The painting, made just outside Arles, is an example of how Van Gogh used color in full brilliance to depict \"the burning brightness of the heat wave.\" The painting is also called the Grain Harvest of Provence or Corn Harvest of Provence.\nIn the foreground of Honolulu Museum of Art's Wheat Field are sheaves of harvested wheat.  Horizontal bands mark the wheat fields, behind which are trees and houses on the horizon.  His work, like that of his friend Paul Gauguin, that emphasized personal expression over literal composition led to the expressionist movement and towards twentieth-century Modernism.\nWheat Stacks with Reaper, 1890, Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo, Ohio (F559)\nHarvest in Provence, June 1888, Israel Museum, Jerusalem, Israel (F558)\nWheat Fields or Wheat Fields with Sheaves, June 1888, Honolulu, Honolulu Museum of Art (F561)\nGreen Ears of Wheat 1888, Israel Museum, Jerusalem,\nWheat Fields with Stacks 1888 Private collection (no catalog F number, JH 1478)\nWheat Fields, June 1888, P. and N. de Boer Foundation or Van Gogh Museum (F564)\nHarvest, named by Van Gogh himself, or Harvest at La Crau, with Montmajour in the Background is made in horizontal planes.  The harvested wheat lies in the foreground. In the center the activities for harvest are represented by the haystack, ladders, carts and a man with a pitchfork.  The background is purple-blue mountains against a turquoise sky. He was interested in depicting \"the essence of country life.\" In June Van Gogh wrote of the landscape at La Crau that it was \"beautiful and endless as the sea.\"  One of his most important works, the landscape reminded him of paintings by 17th century Dutch masters, Ruysdael and Philips Koninck. He also compared this work favorably with his painting The White Orchard.\nWheat Stacks in Provence, made about the 12th or 13 June, was intended by Van Gogh to be a complementary work to the Harvest painting.  Ladders appear in both paintings which help to create a pastoral feeling.\nHarvest or Harvest at La Crau, with Montmajour in the Background, June 1888, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, Netherlands (F412)\nHaystacks near a Farm in Provence, June 1888, Oil on canvas, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands (F425)\nIn May 1889, Van Gogh voluntarily entered the asylum of St. Paul near Saint-Rémy in Provence. There Van Gogh had access to an adjacent cell he used as his studio. He was initially confined to the immediate asylum grounds and painted (without the bars) the world he saw from his room, such as ivy covered trees, lilacs, and irises of the garden. Through the open bars Van Gogh could also see an enclosed wheat field, subject of many paintings at Saint-Rémy. As he ventured outside of the asylum walls, he painted the wheat fields, olive groves, and cypress trees of the surrounding countryside, which he saw as \"characteristic of Provence.\" Over the course of the year, he painted about 150 canvases.\nVan Gogh worked on a group of paintings of the wheat field that he could see from his cell at Saint-Paul Hospital.  From the studio room he could see a field of wheat, enclosed by a wall.  Beyond that were the mountains from Arles.  During his stay at the asylum he made about twelve paintings of the view of the enclosed wheat field and distant mountains. In May Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"Through the iron-barred window I see a square field of wheat in an enclosure, a perspective like Van Goyen, above which I see the morning sun rising in all its glory.\" The stone wall, like a picture frame, helped to display the changing colors of the wheat field.\nEnclosed Wheat Field with Rising Sun, May 1889, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands (F720)\nGreen Wheat Field, June 1889, owner unclear, possibly on loan to Kunsthaus Zurich, Zurich (F718)\nWheat Field with Reaper and Sun, Late June 1889, Oil on canvas, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands (F617)\nLandscape with Wheat Sheaves and Rising Moon, July 1889, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands (F735)\nWheat Field with Reaper, September 1889, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F618)\nRain or Enclosed Wheat Field in the Rain, November 1889, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia (F650)\nThe wheat field with cypresses paintings were made when van Gogh was able to leave the asylum. Van Gogh had a fondness for cypresses and wheat fields of which he wrote: \"Only I have no news to tell you, for the days are all the same, I have no ideas, except to think that a field of wheat or a cypress well worth the trouble of looking at closeup.\"\nIn early July, Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo of a work he began in June, Wheat Field with Cypresses: \"I have a canvas of cypresses with some ears of wheat, some poppies, a blue sky like a piece of Scotch plaid; the former painted with a thick impasto . . . and the wheat field in the sun, which represents the extreme heat, very thick too.\" Van Gogh who regarded this landscape as one of his \"best\" summer paintings made two additional oil paintings very similar in composition that fall.  One of the two is in a private collection.\nLondon's National Gallery A Wheat Field, with Cypresses painting was made in September which Janson & Janson 1977, p. 308 describes: \"the field is like a stormy sea; the trees spring flamelike from the ground; and the hills and clouds heave with the same surge of motion.  Every stroke stands out boldly in a long ribbon of strong, unmixed color.\"\nThere is also another version of Wheat Fields with Cypresses made in September with a blue-green sky, reportedly held at the Tate Gallery in London (F743).\nWheat Field with Cypresses, June–July 1889, Oil on canvas, 73 x 93.4 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (F717)\nA Wheat Field, with Cypresses, September 1889, National Gallery, London (F615)\nVan Gogh describes the ripening Green Wheat Field with Cypress painted in June: \"a field of wheat turning yellow, surrounded by blackberry bushes and green shrubs. At the end of the field there is a little house with a tall somber cypress which stands out against the far-off hills with their violet-like and bluish tones, and against a sky the colour of forget-me-nots with pink streaks, whose pure hues form a contrast with the scorched ears, which are already heavy, and have the warm tones of a bread crust.\"\nIn October Van Gogh made Enclosed Wheat Field with Ploughman.\nGreen Wheat Field with Cypress, 1889, Narodni Gallery, Prague (F719)\nEnclosed Field with Peasant, October 1889, Indianapolis Museum of Art, Indianapolis, Indiana\nEnclosed Wheat Field with Ploughman, October 1889, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (F706)\nWheat Fields in a Mountainous Landscape, also titled Meadow in the Mountains was painted in late November – early December 1889. In November, Wheat Field Behind Saint-Paul was painted by Van Gogh, now owned by Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.\nWheat Fields in a Mountainous Landscape, Late November-Early December 1889, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands (F721)\nWheat Field Behind Saint-Paul, November 1889, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, Virginia (F722)\nIn May 1890, Van Gogh traveled from Saint-Rémy to Paris, where he had a three-day stay with his brother, Theo, Theo's wife Johanna and their new baby Vincent.  Van Gogh found that unlike his past experiences in Paris, he was no longer used to the commotion of the city and was too agitated to paint.  His brother, Theo and artist Camille Pissarro developed a plan for Van Gogh to go to Auvers-sur-Oise with a letter of introduction for Dr. Paul Gachet, a homeopathic physician and art patron who lived in Auvers. Van Gogh had a room at the inn Auberge Ravoux in Auvers and was under the care and supervision of Dr. Gachet with whom he grew to have a close relationship, \"something like another brother.\"\nFor a time, Van Gogh seemed to improve.  He began to paint at such a steady pace, there was barely space in his room for all the finished paintings. From May until his death on July 29, Van Gogh made about 70 paintings, more than one a day, and many drawings..\" Van Gogh painted buildings around the town of Auvers, such as The Church at Auvers, portraits, and the nearby fields.\nVan Gogh arrived in Auvers in late spring as pea plants and wheat fields on gently sloping hills ripened for harvest.  The area bustled as migrant workers from France and Brussels descended on the area for the harvest.  Partial to rural life, Van Gogh strongly portrayed the beauty of the Auvers country side.  He wrote his brother, \"I have one study of old thatched roofs with a field of peas in flower in the foreground and some wheat, the background of hills, a study which I think you will like.\"\nVan Gogh painted thirteen large canvases of horizontal landscapes of the wheat harvest that occurs in the region from the middle to late July. The series began with Wheat Field under Cloudy Sky then Wheatfield with Crows was painted when the crop was on the verge of harvest.  Sheaves of Wheat painted after the harvest and concluding with Field with Haystacks (private collection).\nGreen Wheat Fields or Field with Green Wheat was made in May.\nWheat Field at Auvers with White House was made in June.  The painting is mainly a large green field of wheat.  In the background is a white house behind a wall and a tree.\nThe outlying fields of Auvers, setting for Wheat Fields after the Rain (The Plain of Auvers), form a \"zig-zag, patchwork pattern,\" of yellows, blues, and greens. In the last letter that Van Gogh wrote to his mother he described being very calm, something needed for this work, an \"immense plain with wheat fields up as far as the hills, boundless as the ocean, delicate yellow, delicate soft green, the delicate purple of a tilled and weeded piece of ground, with the regular speckle of the green of flowering potato plants, everything under a sky of delicate tones of blue, white, pink and violet.\" This painting was also called Wheat Fields at Auvers Under Clouded Sky.\nField with Green Wheat, 1890, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (F807)\nWheat Field at Auvers with White House, June 1890, The Phillips Collection, Washington D.C. (F804)\nVan Gogh described Ears of Wheat to painter and friend Paul Gauguin as \"nothing more than ears of wheat, green-blue stalks long, ribbon-like leaves, under a sheen of green & pink; ears of wheat, yellowing slightly, with an edge made pale pink by the dusty manner of flowering; at the bottom, a pink bindweed winding round a stalk. I would like to paint portraits against a background that is so lively and yet so still.\"  The painting depicts \"the soft rustle of the ears of grain swaying back and forth in the wind.\"  He used the motif as the background to a portrait.\nThe Fields was painted in July and held in a private collection.\nAn animated Wheatfield with Cornflowers shows the effect of a gust of wind that ripples through the yellow stalks, seeming to \"overflow\" into the blue background.  The heads of a few stalks of wheat seem to have detached themselves, diving into the blue of the hills in the background.\nEars of Wheat, June 1890, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, Netherlands (F767)\nThe Fields, July 1890, Private Collection (F761)\nWheat Field with Cornflowers, July 1890, Oil on canvas, 60 x 81 cm, Beyeler Foundation, Riehen, Switzerland (F808)\nWheat Fields near Auvers, 1890, owned by Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, Vienna was also described by van Gogh as a landscape of the vast wheat fields after a rain.\nVan Gogh brings the spectator directly into Sheaves of Wheat by filling the picture plane with eight sheaves of wheat, as if seeing it from a worker's perspective. The sheaves, bathed in yellow light, appear to be recently cut.  For contrast, Van Gogh uses the complementary, vivid lavender for shadows and earth in the nearby field.\nWheat Fields near Auvers, 1890, Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, Vienna (F775)\nSheaves of Wheat, 1890, Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas, Texas.

Others have claimed Tree Roots was his last painting.  Wheatfield with Crows, made on an elongated canvas, depicts a dramatic cloudy sky filled with crows over a wheat field. The wind-swept wheat field fills two thirds of the canvas.  An empty path pulls the audience into the painting.  Jules Michelet, one of Van Gogh's favorite authors, wrote of the crow: \"They interest themselves in everything, and observe everything.  The ancients, who lived far more completely than ourselves in and with nature, found it no small profit to follow, in a hundred obscure things where human experience as yet affords no light, the directions so prudent and sage a bird.\"  Of making the painting Van Gogh wrote that he did not have a hard time depicting the sadness and emptiness of the painting, which was powerfully offset by the restorative nature of the countryside. Erickson 1998, pp. 103, 148, cautious of attributing stylistic changes in his work to mental illness, finds the painting expresses both the sorrow and the sense of his life coming to an end. The crows, used by Van Gogh as symbol of death and rebirth or resurrection, visually draw the spectator into the painting.  The road, in contrasting colors of red and green, is thought to be a metaphor for a sermon he gave based on Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress where the pilgrim is sorrowful that the road is so long, yet rejoicing because the Eternal City waits at the journey's end.Erickson 1998, p. 162\nWheat Stack Under Clouded Sky also called Haystack under a Rainy Sky, was made July 1890, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands (F563).\nWheatfield Under Thunderclouds, 1890, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, Netherlands (F778)\nWheatfield with Crows, July 1890, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F779)\nWheat Stack Under Clouded Sky, July 1890, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands (F563)\nField with Stacks of Grain, at Beyeler Foundation, Riehen, Switzerland (F809) is one of van Gogh's last paintings, is both more rigid and at the same time more abstract than other paintings of this series, such as Wheatfield with Cornflowers.

He was considering leaving his employer to start his own business.  Gachet, said to have his own eccentricities and neurosis, caused van Gogh to write: \"Now when one blind man leads another blind man, don't they both end up in the ditch?\"\nAfter visiting Paris for a family conference, Van Gogh returned to Auvers feeling more bleak.  In a letter he wrote, \"And the prospect grows darker, I see no future at all.\"\nWallace 1969, pp. 162–163 states, \"But for all his appearance of a renewed well-being his life was very near its end.\" \nHe later had a period where he said that \"the trouble I had in my head has considerably calmed...I am completely absorbed in that immense plain covered with fields of wheat against the hills boundless as the sea in delicate colors of yellow and green, the pale violet of the plowed and weeded earth checkered at regular intervals with the green of the flowering potato plants, everything under a sky of delicate blue, white, pink, and violet. I am almost too calm, a state that is necessary to paint all that.\"\nFour days after completing Wheat Fields after the Rain he shot himself in the Auvers wheat fields.  Van Gogh died on July 29, 1890.\n"

    "short_description": "Triptych by Francis Bacon",
    "painting_info": "\nTriptych Inspired by the Oresteia of Aeschylus is a 1981 oil on canvas triptych painting by Francis Bacon.  It is one of 28 large triptych paintings by Bacon, each comprising three oil on canvas panels which measure 198 cm × 147.5 cm (78.0 in × 58.1 in).\nThe work draws inspiration from The Oresteia, a trilogy of ancient Greek tragic plays by Aeschylus, which was also an inspiration for other earlier large triptychs, including Bacon's 1944 breakthrough Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion.  The Oresteia recounts three linked mythic tales of revenge: the first recounting the murder of King Agamemnon after he returned from the Siege of Troy, with Queen Clytemnestra killing her husband to avenge his sacrifice of their daughter Iphigenia to secure a safe journey home; in the second, their son Orestes murders Clytemnestra to avenge his father; and in the third, Orestes is pursued by the Erinyes, also known as the Furies, the three female deities of vengeance.\nIn a letter sent to Michel Leiris in 1981, Bacon described re-reading read Aeschylus: he did not want to create a historical painting of one of the characters, such as Agamemnon or Clytemnestra; rather, he tried \"to create images of the sensations that some of the episodes created inside me … an image of the effect that was produced inside me.\" \nThe violence of The Oresteia found echoes in Bacon's own tortured personal life, from the physical abuse he suffered at the hands of his father, through his preference for roughly masochistic homosexual encounters, and the suicide of his lover George Dyer.\nThe triptych form echoes a Christian altarpiece, with the main \"crucifixion\" in the central panel flanked by two supporting figures.  Each panel depicts abstracted body parts in a space delineated by cream walls meeting beige floors.  In the central panel, the mutilated body of the king, with the spine exposed, is raised on a box-like dais, with blocks of the floor and wall coloured blood red.  In each of the left and right panels, the monstrous form of a Fury is suspended in a wire framed box in front of an open door.  In the left panel, a bloody smear spreads across the floor from under an open door, and the Fury has blood spurting from an orifice.  The fleshy shape of the Fury in the left panel was based on photographs of a pelican in flight taken by Eadweard Muybridge.\nThe triptych was sold by Marlborough Fine Art to the Norwegian industrialist and art collector Hans Rasmus Astrup in 1984.  It was displayed at the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art in Oslo from its foundation in 1993, until it was deaccessioned and sold in 2020, to put the museum on a stronger financial basis and to enable it to make new acquisitions to diversify its collection.  An auction scheduled for 13 May 2020 was postponed, and the painting was eventually sold for US$84,550,000 in an online auction held by Sotheby's in New York on 29 June 2020. The price was the third highest paid for a Bacon work at auction, after the US$142.4 million paid for Three Studies of Lucian Freud in 2013, and US$86.3 million paid for Triptych, 1976 in 2008.\n"

    "painting_info": "\nDiana and Actaeon is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Titian, finished in 1556–1559, and is considered amongst Titian's greatest works. It portrays the moment in which the hunter Actaeon bursts in where the goddess Diana and her nymphs are bathing. Diana is furious, and will turn Actaeon into a stag, who is then pursued and killed by his own hounds, a scene Titian later painted in his The Death of Actaeon (National Gallery).\nDiana is the woman on the right side of the painting. She is wearing a crown with a crescent moon on it and is being covered by the dark skinned woman who may be her servant.  The nymphs display a variety of reactions, and a variety of nude poses.\nIn 2008–2009, the National Gallery, London and National Galleries of Scotland successfully campaigned to acquire the painting from the Bridgewater Collection for £50 million.  As a result, Diana and Actaeon will remain on display in the UK, and will alternate between the two galleries on five-year terms.\nDiana and Actaeon is part of a series of seven famous canvases, the \"poesies\", depicting mythological scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses painted for Philip II of Spain (after Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor had declined Titian's offer to paint them for him). The work remained in the Spanish royal collection until 1704, when King Philip V gave it to the French ambassador. It was soon acquired by Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, nephew of Louis XIV, and Regent of France during the minority of Louis XV, for his collection, one of the finest ever assembled. After the French Revolution, the Orleans collection was sold to a Brussels dealer by Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans in 1791, two years before he was guillotined. This dealer then exhibited many pictures from the collection (including the Titians) in London.\nThe largest share of the collection was thus bought in 1798 by the coal-magnate Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, including this painting, Titian's Diana and Callisto (from the same mythological series of seven paintings), eight paintings by Poussin, three Raphaels and Rembrandt's Self-Portrait, aged 51.\nThe third Duke of Bridgewater was probably inspired to buy the paintings by his nephew, Earl Gower, the ancestor of the Dukes of Sutherland. Certainly, on Bridgewater's death five years after the purchase, he bequeathed the Titians and the rest of the collection to Gower, who put it on display to the public in his London house – it has been on public display ever since. On first seeing the collection there, William Hazlitt wrote \"I was staggered when I saw the works ... A new sense came upon me, a new heaven and a new Earth stood before me.\". On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the collection was moved from London to Scotland. Between 1945 and 2009, the Diana and Actaeon and Diana and Callisto (with other paintings from the collection, known collectively as \"the Bridgewater loan\" or \"the Sutherland Loan\") were on long-term display at the National Gallery of Scotland, in Edinburgh. As well as Hazlitt, during their time on public display they have inspired artists such as J. M. W. Turner and Lucian Freud — Freud described the pair as \"simply the most beautiful pictures in the world\".\nThe Sutherland collection has passed by descent to the 7th Duke of Sutherland, (most of whose wealth is contained in the paintings collection), but in late August 2008 the 7th Duke announced that he wished to sell some of the collection in order to diversify his assets. He had offered them as a pair to the British national galleries at £100 million (a third of their overall estimated market price) if they could demonstrate, by the end of 2008, the ability to raise that sum — if not, the pair or other paintings from the Bridgewater collection would be put on public auction early in 2009. Within days of the Duke's decision, the NGS and the National Gallery, London had announced they would combine forces to raise the sum, initially in the form of £50 million (or a demonstration that this money could be raised) to purchase Diana and Actaeon and paid over three years in instalments and then £50 million for Diana and Callisto paid for similarly from 2013.\nThough the campaign received some criticism for the Duke's motives or (from John Tusa and Nigel Carrington of the University of the Arts London) for distracting from funding art students, it gained press support from both the tabloid and broadsheet print media in the UK – imitative nude photoshoots of it were featured in both The Sun (using the newspaper's Page 3 models photoshopped onto the painting) and The Mirror (including the actor Kim Cattrall and featured in a piece by Andrew Graham-Dixon on The Culture Show). On 14 October 2008 the appeal received £1 million from the Art Fund and on 19 November this was followed by £10 million from the National Heritage Memorial Fund. From 22 October to 14 December 2008 it was put on display in Room 1 of the National Gallery in London to aid the public appeal – the only other painting in this temporary exhibition was the related The Death of Actaeon from the London National Gallery's collection, and they were illustrated by the relevant passages from Book 3 of Ovid's Metamorphoses in the John Dryden translation.\nSpeculation began when the original 31 December deadline passed without definite news and the Scottish Government's announcement of a contribution of £17.5 million in January 2009 triggered a political row, with Ian Davidson questioning the deal at a time of economic hardship. There was also controversy over attempts to dilute the guarantee that the duke would sell no other of the paintings from the Sutherland Loan should the two Titians be bought. However, on 2 February 2009 it was announced that, thanks to the deadline being extended to raise more funds and finalise the payment plan for Diana and Callisto, the £50 million had been raised and Diana and Actaeon would be acquired. The final sum was made up of £12.5 million from the Scottish Government, £7.4 million from public donations, £12.5 million from the National Galleries in London, £10 million from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, £2 million from the Monument Trust, £4.6 million from the National Galleries of Scotland and £1 million was secured from the Art Fund. Diana and Actaeon will thus be displayed in Scotland for five years, then in London alongside The Death of Actaeon for five years, on an alternating basis.\nDanaë\nVenus and Adonis\nDiana and Actaeon\nDiana and Callisto\nPerseus and Andromeda\nThe Rape of Europa\nThe Death of Actaeon\n"

    "painting_info": "Au Lapin Agile (English: At the Lapin Agile) is a 1905 oil on canvas painting by Pablo Picasso. It depicts the interior of the Lapin Agile, a famous cabaret club in the Montmartre area of Paris. The composition was produced during Picasso's Rose Period and includes a self-portrait of the artist who frequented the club in his youth. The painting is listed as one of the most expensive paintings after achieving a price of $40.7 million at Sotheby's auction on 27 November 1989. It is housed in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\nThis painting was produced in 1905, just a few years after the young Picasso and his friend Carles Casagemas settled in Paris in 1900. Not only did they find a new social circle in the artists of Montmartre, but they also became acquainted with a married seamstress named Germaine Pichot. Casagemas became obsessed with Pichot and relentlessly pursued her, but his affections were never returned. Picasso and his friends frequented a local cabaret club known as the Lapin Agile, where they drank and exchanged ideas with other artists. On 17 February 1901, during an evening drink with friends, Casagemas shot at Pichot with a revolver and then shot himself in the head. Picasso was greatly affected by the death of his friend and this tragic event is considered to be the major catalyst for the onset of Picasso's Blue Period. However, despite this emotional trauma, Picasso had an affair with Pichot after the event. In 1905, he was asked by the owner of the Lapin Agile, Frédéric Gérard, to produce a painting that would be hung inside. Picasso agreed in exchange for free food and drinks and created Au Lapin Agile at the age of 25.\nAu Lapin Agile depicts a melancholy image of a couple sitting at a bar inside the Lapin Agile. The composition is simple, with little background detail, except for the presence of the bar upon which the couple stand their drinks and the small stage at the rear. The painting features three figures, a harlequin in the foreground, a woman sitting next to him wearing an orange dress and a feather boa, and a guitarist playing in the background. Picasso conveys a sombre scene by primarily using murky reddish-brown hues. The style of this painting is reminiscent of the works of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.\nThe painting depicts figures from Picasso's personal life during this period. The harlequin in the scene is a brooding self-portrait of Picasso, while the woman sitting next to him is Germaine Pichot. The guitarist is Frédéric Gérard, the new owner of the club. Picasso painted himself as the most prominent figure in the scene, ensuring that he would also hold a prominent position in the main room at the club where the painting was to be hung.\nColumbia University art historian Theodore Reff has noted the alienation of the couple in the painting, which may reflect Picasso's own mood whilst in the company of Pichot, following the death of Casagemas.\nFrédéric Gérard commissioned the painting and exhibited it at the Lapin Agile from 1905 to 1912, when it was sold to a German collector.\nIn 1952, Joan Whitney Payson bought the painting in New York for $60,000. When she died in 1975, it was inherited by her daughter, Lorinda de Roulet.\nOn 27 November 1989, Walter H. Annenberg bought the painting at auction from the Joan Whitney Payson family for $40.7 million. He gave the painting to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n"

    "short_description": "Painting by Thomas Eakins",
    "painting_info": "The Gross Clinic or The Clinic of Dr. Gross is an 1875 painting by American artist Thomas Eakins. It is oil on canvas and measures 8 feet (240 cm) by 6.5 feet (200 cm).\nThe painting depicts Dr. Samuel D. Gross, a seventy-year-old professor dressed in a black frock coat, lecturing a group of Jefferson Medical College students. Included among the group is a self-portrait of Eakins, who is seen at the right-hand side of the painting, next to the tunnel railing, with a white cuffed sleeve sketching or writing. Seen over Dr. Gross's right shoulder is the clinic clerk, Dr. Franklin West, taking notes on the operation.\nEakins's signature is painted on the front of the surgical table.\nAdmired for its uncompromising realism, The Gross Clinic has an important place documenting the history of medicine—both because it honors the emergence of surgery as a healing profession (in previous years surgery was associated primarily with amputation, which caused severe medical complications, sometimes killing the person), and because it shows what a surgical theater looked like in the nineteenth century.\nThe painting is based on a surgery witnessed by Eakins, in which Gross treated a young man for osteomyelitis of the femur.  Gross is pictured here performing a conservative operation, as opposed to the amputation normally carried out.\nHere, surgeons crowd around the anesthetized patient in their frock coats—this is just prior to the adoption of a hygienic surgical environment (see asepsis).  The Gross Clinic is thus often contrasted with Eakins's later painting The Agnew Clinic (1889), which depicts a cleaner, brighter, surgical theater, with the participants in \"white coats\". In comparing the two, the advance in understanding of the prevention of infection is seen.  Another noteworthy difference in the later painting is the presence of a professional nurse, Mary Clymer, in the operating theater.\nIt is assumed that the patient depicted in The Gross Clinic was a teenage boy, although the exposed body is not entirely discernible as male or female; the painting is shocking for both the odd presentation of this figure and the matter-of-fact goriness of the procedure.\nAdding to the drama is the lone woman in the painting seen in the middle ground, possibly the patient's mother, cringing in distress.  Her dramatic figure functions as a strong contrast to the calm, professional demeanor of the men who surround the patient. This bloody and very blunt depiction of surgery was shocking at the time it was first exhibited.\nThe painting was submitted for the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, but was rejected by the Committee of Selection. When it was eventually displayed in Ward One of the U.S. Army Post Hospital, a critic for the New York Tribune wrote that it was:\n...one of the most powerful, horrible, yet fascinating pictures that has been painted anywhere in this century...but the more one praises it, the more one must condemn its admission to a gallery where men and women of weak nerves must be compelled to look at it, for not to look at it is impossible.Another critic, writing in 1885, said:\nIt is characterized by so many excellent artistic qualities, that one regrets that the work as a whole fails to satisfy. Admirable draughtsman as this painter is, one is surprised that in the arrangement of the figures the perspective should have been so ineffective that the mother is altogether too small for the rest of the group, and the figure of the patient so indistinct that it is difficult to tell exactly the part of the body upon which the surgeon is performing the operation. The monochromatic tone of the composition is, perhaps, intentional, in order to concentrate the effect on the bloody thigh and the crimson finger of the operating professor. But as it is, the attention is at once and so entirely directed on that reeking hand as to convey the impression that such concentration was the sole purpose of the painting. In similar paintings by Ribera, Regnault, and other artists of the horrible, as vivid a result is obtained without sacrificing the light and color in the other parts of the picture; and the effect, while no less intense, is, therefore, less startling and loud.These assessments were not universal. The critic for Philadelphia's The Evening Telegraph, who may have been aware of the personal politics involved in the advisory group of artists who rejected it, wrote:\nThere is nothing so fine in the American section of the Art Department of the Exhibition, and it is a great pity that the squeamishness of the Selecting Committee compelled the artist to find a place for it in the United States Hospital building. It is rumored that the blood on Dr. Gross' fingers made some of the members of the committee sick, but, judging from the quality of the work exhibited by them we fear that it was not the blood alone that made them sick. Artists have before now been known to sicken at the sight of pictures by younger men which they in their souls were compelled to acknowledge were beyond their emulation.Controversy about the painting has centered on its violence, and on the melodramatic presence of the woman. Modern scholars have suggested that the painting may be read in terms of castration anxiety and fantasies of mastery over the body (e.g. Michael Fried), and that it documents Eakins's ambivalence about representing sex difference (e.g. Jennifer Doyle). The painting has also been understood to be drawing an analogy between painting and surgery and as identifying the work of the artist with the emergence of surgery as a respected profession.\nIn 2002, Michael Kimmelman of The New York Times called it \"hands down, the finest 19th-century American painting.\"  In 2006, in response to the impending sale of this painting, The New York Times published a \"close reading\" which sketches some of the different critical perspectives on this work of art.\nAfter its purchase for US$200 at the time of the Centennial Exhibition, the painting was housed in the College Building of Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia until it was moved in the mid-1980s to Jefferson Alumni Hall. Although undocumented, in the late-1970s there was a rumor of a substantial offer by a collector who wished to donate the painting to the National Gallery of Art. On November 11, 2006, the Thomas Jefferson University Board voted to sell the painting for US$68 million to the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the new Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, then under construction in Bentonville, Arkansas. The sale would represent a record price for an artwork made in the United States prior to World War II.\nThe proposed sale was seen as a secretive act. In late November 2006, efforts began to keep the painting in Philadelphia, including a fund with a December 26 deadline to raise money to purchase it and a plan to invoke a clause regarding \"historic objects\" in the city's historic preservation code.  In a matter of weeks the fund raised $30 million, and on December 21, 2006, Wachovia Bank agreed to lend the difference until the rest of the money had been raised, keeping the painting in town at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.\nPledges alone were not enough to cover the US$68 million purchase price. The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts was forced to deaccession Eakins's The Cello Player to an unidentified private buyer; and the Philadelphia Museum of Art deaccessioned Eakins's Cowboy Singing, along with two oil sketches for Cowboys in the Badlands, to the Anschutz collection and the Denver Art Museum. The Denver-based Anschutz collection purchased Cowboys in the Badlands at a May 22, 2003 auction at Christie's New York for $5,383,500, which was the previous record for an Eakins painting.\nA reproduction of The Gross Clinic sits in the place of the original at Thomas Jefferson University. Every year at the graduation ceremony, graduating fellows of Vascular Neurology & Neurocritical Care Departments under the Department of Neurology at Thomas Jefferson University receive a reproduction print of the painting as a parting gift.\nCompositional study (1875), Philadelphia Museum of Art.\nStudy for Dr. Gross (1875), Worcester Art Museum, Worcester, MA.\nBlack and white drawing of the painting (1875), Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. This illustration was probably made to be photographed.\nDrawing of Two Heads (1876), Philadelphia Museum of Art.\nStudy of Robert C. V. Meyers (1875), private collection.\nThe painting has been restored three times. The first restoration between 1917 and 1925 substantially damaged the painting, rendering secondary figures in the composition inconsistently bright or reddish in color.  In 1929, Susan Macdowell Eakins, the artist's widow, wrote a letter of complaint regarding the \"fancy red light\" that had falsified the painting's intended tones.\nThe painting's backing was reinforced with plywood by H. Stevenson in 1915. This was replaced in 1940 by Hannah Mee Horner, who glued the painting to a plywood backing. Within two decades, this backing began to warp and threatened to tear the painting in half.\nIn 1961, at the request of Jefferson Medical College, the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA) undertook another restoration, under conservator Theodor Siegl. Mark Tucker, a later PMA conservator, described the work as \"a rescue mission... They were saving the painting from tearing itself in half. These were the nail heads that were starting to work forward into the canvas and show as bumps on the front... Yeah. It was just hair-raising.\" Siegl used a power plane to remove the plywood down to the last, thin ply. The rest of the wood and the tenacious glue were painstakingly removed by hand. Siegl and his colleagues also restored, to some extent, the faces in the upper right of the canvas.\nIn 2009, in response to long term concerns regarding inconsistencies in the painting's disposition of darkness and light, conservators at the Philadelphia Museum of Art undertook restoration of The Gross Clinic from July 2009 to July 2010, during which time the painting was not publicly visible. The restoration sought to revert changes that had been made by the Jefferson Medical College during the 1917 restoration. Definition of parts, including Eakins' self-portrayal, was restored, using as reference an ink wash copy of the painting made by the artist, as well as a photograph taken by the Metropolitan Museum of Art previous to the Medical College's changes in 1917.\n"

    "painting_info": "Femme aux Bras Croisés (English: Woman with Folded Arms), is an oil on canvas painting by Pablo Picasso, which he created between 1901 and 1902 during his Blue Period. The subject of the painting is unknown, but she is considered to be an inmate of the Saint-Lazare hospital-prison in Paris. The painting is listed as one of the most expensive paintings after it achieved a price of $55 million at Christie's auction on 8 November 2000.\nThis painting is considered to be an important work dating from Picasso's Blue Period. This period began in 1901 and ended in 1904 with the beginning of his Rose Period. The Blue Period represents an important shift in Picasso's approach from his previous work in terms of style and subject matter. In place of the popular scenes of urban leisure, he began to experiment with monochromes and focus on melancholy themes of poverty, loneliness and death. His paintings were now dominated by shades of blue and featured portraits of destitute, sick people and prostitutes. Picasso's friend Pierre Daix commented that this announced Picasso's \"...descent into hell... the depths of solitude and despair\". This new style was heavily influenced by the death of Picasso's close friend Carles Casagemas, who committed suicide in 1901.\nFemme aux Bras Croisés is a portrait of a woman sitting in a prison cell. The image conveys an atmosphere of misery and torment, which is achieved by the woman's body posture and the starkness of her surroundings. Her crossed arms and blank stare illustrate her isolation, while her physical and emotional disconnection reflects her social isolation.\nIt is believed that the painting was begun in France in the second half of 1901 and then moved to Spain, where Picasso made changes to the composition. This was confirmed by x-ray, which showed that Picasso had repainted the woman's hair over a previous hood.\nIn her 1957 book Pablo Picasso, Antonina Vallentin discusses the haunting qualities of this painting. She considers the subject to be an inmate who recently attempted suicide and now carries the blank but menacing stare of those unfortunates who found themselves at Saint-Lazare hospital-prison during the early 1900s.\nPicasso often visited the Saint-Lazare hospital-prison in Paris in the second half of 1901 to find models for his paintings. John Richardson commented that, \"The Saint-Lazare women were victims of society nobody would deny, but they are also to some extent Picasso's victims. There is a hint of eroticism, even sadism, to their portrayal... Years later Picasso would describe women with some relish as 'suffering machines'. No wonder there is more romantic agony than social criticism to Blue period imagery\".\nPicasso used monochromatic colour to reinforce the sense of isolation and despair in his paintings. The dominant use of blue tones is particularly significant. Juan-Eduardo Cirlot comments that, \"It is a blue which makes us think of night, but it is the symbol rather of maternal protection, of rest and forgetful dreams to soothe the sufferings of humble people, than of dark hostile power. Picasso has always been deeply humanitarian...  sensitive to human suffering, and he seems to have been strongly impelled to translate it into paint.\"\nChristie's describes the significance of Picasso's Blue Period paintings. \"The paintings of the Blue period comprise some of Picasso's most concise and compelling portrayals of human emotion.  Above all, Picasso concentrated on the expressive possibilities of the human form, as exemplified in seminal works such as Femme aux bras croisés.\"\nGertrude Stein originally bought the painting from Picasso. From 1936 it was in the collection of the family of Chauncey McCormick, who lent it to the Art Institute of Chicago. On 8 November 2000 it sold at auction at Christie's, New York, for $55 million.\n"

    "painting_info": "Nude Sitting on a Divan (The Beautiful Roman Woman) is an oil on canvas painting by Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani depicting a partially draped woman seated with crossed legs against a warm red background. The work was one of a series of nudes painted by Modigliani in 1917 that created a sensation when exhibited in Paris that year. On November 2, 2010, the painting sold at a New York auction for $68.9 million, a record price for an artwork by Modigliani.\nThe several dozen nudes Modigliani painted between 1916 and 1919 constitute many of his best-known works. Simultaneously abstracted and erotically detailed, they exhibit a formal grace referencing nude figures of the Italian Renaissance while at the same time objectifying their subjects' sexuality; they \"exemplify his position between tradition and modernism\". The nudes of this period are \"displayed boldly, with only the faintest suggestion of setting.... neither demure nor provocative, they are depicted with a degree of objectivity. Yet the uniformly thick, rough application of paint— as if applied by a sculptor's hand— is more concerned with mass and the visceral perception of the female body than with titillation and the re-creation of translucent, tactile flesh\".\nThis series of nudes was commissioned by Modigliani's dealer and friend Leopold Zborowski, who lent the artist use of his apartment, supplied models and painting materials, and paid him between fifteen and twenty francs each day for his work. The paintings  from this arrangement were thus different from his previous depictions of friends and lovers in that they were funded by Zborowski either for his own collection, as a favor to his friend, or with an eye to their \"commercial potential\", rather than originating from the artist's personal circle of acquaintances. \nThe Paris show of 1917 was Modigliani's only solo exhibition during his life, and is \"notorious\" in modern art history for its sensational public reception and the attendant issues of obscenity. The show was closed by police on its opening day, but continued thereafter, most likely after the removal of paintings from the gallery's streetfront window.\nAccording to the catalogue description from the 2010 sale at Sotheby's, seven nudes were exhibited in the 1917 show, four of them titled Nu; \"the present work may have been among these pictures.... the models' permissiveness and the artist's accessibility to them implied that these oils were post coital-renderings, the women still flush and basking in the afterglow\".\nIn 1999 Nude Sitting on a Divan sold at Sotheby's for $16.7 million, a record price for a painting by the artist. The most recent sale far surpassed the pre-sale estimate of $40 million, as well as the previous record for one of Modigliani's works, $52.6 million for a sculpture.\n"

In 2022, it was sold for $85 million at Phillips, becoming Basquiat's third highest auction sale and fourth most expensive painting.\nUntitled was executed by Jean-Michel Basquiat in Modena, Italy in 1982, which is considered his most valuable year. A majority of the highest-selling Basquiat paintings at auction date to 1982. That year he also became the youngest artist ever invited to participate in Documenta in Kassel, Germany. Basquiat had initially been invited to Modena in 1981 by art dealer Emilio Mazzoli, for his first one-man show at Galleria d'Arte Emilio Mazzoli, after he had seen Basquiat's work at the New York/New Wave February 1981 show at New York's MoMA PS1. Basquiat returned to Modena in March 1982, and during this trip he created a series of paintings; Untitled being the largest at over sixteen feet wide and almost eight feet tall.\nThe artwork has often been identified as a self-portrait depicting Basquiat as a devil. It is dominated by sporadic brushwork and an array of vivid colors overlapping a fiery black devil at its center.

    "short_description": "Painting by Titian in London and Edinburgh",
    "painting_info": "\nDiana and Callisto is a painting completed between 1556 and 1559 by the Italian late Renaissance  artist Titian. It portrays the moment in which the goddess Diana discovers that her maid Callisto has become pregnant by Jupiter. The painting was jointly purchased by the National Gallery and the Scottish National Gallery for £45 million in March 2012. Along with its companion painting Diana and Actaeon it is displayed on an alternating basis between London and Edinburgh. There is a later version by Titian and his workshop in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.\nDiana and Callisto is part of a series of seven famous canvasses, the \"poesies\", depicting mythological scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses painted for Philip II of Spain after Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor had declined Titian's offer to paint them for him. The work remained in the Spanish royal collection until 1704 when King Philip V gave it to the French ambassador. It was soon acquired by Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, nephew of Louis XIV, and Regent of France during the minority of Louis XV, for his collection, one of the finest ever assembled. After the French Revolution, the Orleans collection was sold to a Brussels banker by Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans in 1791, two years before he was guillotined.\nIt was sent to London for sale in 1793 and purchased by a syndicate of three aristocrats, the leader of which, the canal and coal-magnate Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, bought a large number of paintings for himself, including Diana and Callisto and Diana and Actaeon (both from the \"poesie\" series), eight paintings by Poussin, three Raphaels and Rembrandt's \"Self-Portrait, aged 51\".\nBridgewater was probably inspired to buy the paintings by his nephew, Earl Gower, the ancestor of the Dukes of Sutherland. Certainly, on Bridgewater's death five years after the purchase, he bequeathed the Titians and the rest of his collection to Gower, who put it on display to the public in his Bridgewater House in London where it would remain on public display for the next century and a half. Upon first seeing the collection there, William Hazlitt wrote \"I was staggered when I saw the works ... A new sense came upon me, a new heaven and a new Earth stood before me.\" At the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the collection was moved from London to Scotland. Since 1945, both Diana and Actaeon and Diana and Callisto (with other paintings from the collection, known collectively as \"the Bridgewater loan\" or \"the Sutherland Loan\") have resided at the National Gallery of Scotland (NGS) in Edinburgh. Besides Hazlitt, during their time on public display the two Titian paintings have inspired such other artists as J. M. W. Turner and Lucian Freud — Freud has described the pair as \"simply the most beautiful pictures in the world\".\nThe Sutherland collection has passed by descent to Francis Egerton, 7th Duke of Sutherland, most of whose wealth is contained in the paintings collection, but who, in late August 2008 announced his wish to sell some of the collection in order to diversify his assets. He at first offered them as a pair to the British national galleries at £100m (a third of their overall estimated market price) if they could demonstrate by the end of 2008 that they could raise that sum — if not, the pair or other paintings from the Bridgewater collection would be put on public auction in 2009. The NGS and the National Gallery in London announced that they would combine forces to raise £50m (or a demonstration that this money could be raised) to purchase Diana and Actaeon paid over three years in instalments and then £50m for Diana and Callisto to be paid for similarly from 2013.\nThough the campaign received criticism from John Tusa and Nigel Carrington for the Duke's motives and for distracting from funding art students, it gained press support in the UK. On 14 October 2008 the appeal received £1 million from the Art Fund and on 19 November this was followed by £10 million from the National Heritage Memorial Fund.\nSpeculation began when the original December 31 deadline passed without news and the Scottish Government's announcement of a contribution of £17.5 million in January 2009 triggered a political row, with Ian Davidson questioning the deal at a time of economic hardship. There was also controversy over attempts to dilute the guarantee that the duke would sell no other of the paintings from the Sutherland Loan should the two Titians be bought. Finally, on February 2, 2009 it was announced that, thanks to the deadline being extended to raise more funds and finalise the payment plan for the Diana and Callisto, £50m had been raised and the painting would be acquired.  Nicholas Penny, Director of the National Gallery stated that many who had contributed to the Diana and Actaeon appeal had done so \"on the understanding\" that Diana and Callisto would also be purchased, but that raising the second £50m was \"not going to be easily raised. We do believe we can do it, and we've given it a great deal of thought.

    "painting_info": "\nPortrait of George Dyer Talking is an oil painting by Francis Bacon executed in 1966. It is a portrait of his lover George Dyer made at the height of Bacon's creative power. It depicts Dyer sitting on a revolving office stool in a luridly coloured room. His body and face are contorted, and his legs are tightly crossed. His head appears to be framed within a window or door. Above him is a naked hanging lightbulb, a favourite motif of Bacon's. The work contains a number of spatial ambiguities, not least that Dyer's body seems to be positioned both in the fore- and background.\nThe painting was sold at Christie's, London, on 13 February 2014, realizing £42,194,500. The seller was reported by Bloomberg to be Mexican financier David Martínez Guzmán, said to have purchased the painting in a private sale for $12,000,000 some five years before.\nThe painting is formed by sweeping curves, which characterise both the description of his body and the space he occupies. He is painted in a very compact and tense manner; his hands are tightly clasped, rendered in whites and pinks, his broad and muscular neck is painted in wide brush strokes. The formation of his legs, tightly wrapped around each other, is barely distinct. Discarded documents are scattered around his feet. The painting closely resembles the 1966 Portrait of George Dyer Staring at a Blind Cord, in that both feature a hanging cord, and both works are almost Cubist in their rendering of his face.\nGeorge Dyer committed suicide on 24 October 1971, two days before the opening of Bacon's triumphant and career-making retrospective at the Grand Palais. Dyer, then 37, alcoholic, deeply insecure and suffering severe and long-term depression, took an overdose of drink and barbiturates in a room at the Paris hotel shared with Bacon during a brief period of reconciliation following years of bitter recrimination.\nBacon, a near-alcoholic himself, felt an acute sense of mortality and awareness of the fragility of life after his lover's death. This awareness was heightened by the death of many other close friends during the following decade. The commemorative portraits of Dyer completed in the following years are considered amongst Bacon's strongest and most affecting. In most, especially in the triptychs, Dyer is followed by black horizontal fleshy winged creatures, raw and red/pink blobs of dying flesh, or painterly arrows. These devices act both as pointers to the depravity and tragedy of the scene and as manifestations of Bacon's guilt at the death of an emotionally dependent friend.\n"

    "short_description": "Painting series by René Magritte",
    "painting_info": "\nThe Empire of Light (French: L'Empire des lumières) is the title of a succession of paintings by René Magritte. They depict the paradoxical image of a nocturnal landscape beneath a sunlit sky. He explored the theme in 27 paintings (17 oil paintings and 10 gouaches) from the 1940s to the 1960s. The paintings were not planned as a formal series. They have never all been exhibited together and are rarely exhibited in smaller groups. The original French title, L'Empire des Lumieres is sometimes translated as singular, The Empire of Light,: 60 p. : 184 p. and sometimes as plural The Empire of Lights.: 126 p. : 177 p.   Other translations include The Dominion of Light: making the distinction: \"an empire exists in relation to a ruler, a dominion does not necessarily require this.”  \nOne source states the artist was inspired by the works of John Atkinson Grimshaw, an English painter from the Victorian era, who had delighted in his time to paint urban views at sunset. More perceptively, other sources identify the nocturnal paintings by the Belgian symbolist William Degouve de Nuncques (1867 – 1935) as an influence on Magritte's series, specifically his painting The Blind House.: 65 p. : 126 p.    The art historian and former director of the Kröller-Müller Museum in the Netherlands, A. M . Hammacher also observed that Magritte was \"highly interested\" in the landscapes of the great German romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich.: 126 p.  William Rubin made comparisons between some of Max Ernst's frottage paintings, specifically Forest , commenting of Ernst's painting \"the night landscape enigmatically includes a bright daylight sky (Magritte was to explore this same conjunction later in The Empire of Light II).\": 182-184 p.  Comparisons with Salvador Dali's gouache Night and Day Clothes (1936) and Max Ernst's Day and Night (1941–42) in the Menil Collection are also intriguing.\nAn early example of Magritte playing with the idea of the simultaneous appearance of night and day is a gouache painted in 1939 that is now in the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam. In this gouache, the horizon of a twilight sky is sharply lit by a sunset casting a group of trees and houses in the foreground in a black silhouette which is filled with stars and a crescent moon. A book on Magritte published in 1973 identifies the gouache as La Bonne Aventure (Good Fortune),: 126-127 p.  however the website of the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen gives the title as Le poison (The Poison) and states it is the first in the series The Empire of Light.\nAlthough Magritte had already completed a few versions by 1953, a retrospective at the 1954 Venice Biennale included a 1954 version (now in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection) that attracted several collectors with expectations of buying the painting. Magritte ended up producing multiple large, high quality versions that year to satisfy the collectors, and he continued to occasionally explore the theme in paintings for the rest of his life. \nThe motif was included in the designs for a series of murals in the main gaming room at the Municipal Casino at Knokke-Le Zoute in Belgium. Titled The Enchanted Domain, Magritte produced a set of eight easel sized paintings reprising and intergrading numerous themes that had appeared in his previous work. His paintings were then copied to the walls on a 1:6 scale, in a 360-degree panorama (236 ft., 71.93 m. circumference), under his supervision and completed in 1953.: 57-59 pp. \nAnother painting from 1958, in which Magritte switched the lighting, with a sunlit landscape under a night sky is Le salon de Dieu (God's Drawing Room), oil on canvas, 43 x 59 cm., (in the private collection of Arnold Weissberger, New York in 1977).  Magritte discussed the painting in an undated letter to Suzi Gablik stating: \"I'd like to tell you I've brought off a very difficult picture, but which is probably too difficult to be successful? It involves a painting of a daylit landscape with a nocturnal sky (stars and crescent moon). I've painted and repainted this picture and I'm at the disenchanted stage, It's a total failure! A friend found as title Le salon de Dieu (God's Drawing Room): I hesitated a long time in adopting it; a title such as Le bal masqué (The Masked Ball) seemed preferable to me for many reasons, the main one being the total ban on saying anything at all about God. But to see it and reproduce it in paint is possible only if one is a God. While waiting to become one, I'm abandoning the project.\": 179 p.    \nMagritte commented on the paintings in a televised interview in 1956, about the time he received his Guggenheim Prize.: 177 p.  \nFor me, the conception of a painting is an idea of one thing or several things that can become visible through my painting. It is understood that all ideas are not conceptions for pictures. Obviously, an idea must be sufficiently stimulating for me to undertake to paint faithfully the thing or things I have ideated.\n\tThe conception of a picture, that is, the idea, is not visible in the picture: an idea cannot be seen with the eyes. What is represented in a picture is what is visible to the eyes, it is the thing or things that must have been ideated. Thus, what are represented in the picture The Empire of Light are the things I ideated, i.e. a nighttime landscape and a sky such as we see during the day. The landscape evokes night and the sky evokes day. I call this power: poetry.\n\n\tIf I believe this evocation has such poetic power, it is because among other reasons, I have always felt the greatest interest in night and in day, yet without ever having preferred one or the other. This great personal interest in night and day is a feeling of admiration and astonishment.\": 177 p. In 1964, John and Dominique de Menil organized an exhibition of Magritte's work in Houston, Texas. The Belgian surrealist attended the exhibit, replete in an incongruous cowboy hat and boots. André Breton wrote the introduction for the exhibition catalogue and commented on the 'Empire of Light paintings.\n\"Rene Magritte's work and thought could not fail to come out at the opposite pole from the zone of facility - and of capitulation - that goes by the name of \"chiaroscuro.\" To him, inevitably, fell the task of separating the \"subtle\" from the \"dense\", without which effort no transmutation is possible. To attack this problem called for all his audacity - to extract simultaneously what is light from the shadow and what is shadow from the light (L'Empire des Lumieres). In this work the violence done to accepted ideas and conventions is such (I - Breton - have this from Magritte) that most of those who go by quickly think they saw the stars in the daytime sky.\": 7 p. All works are oil on canvas unless noted otherwise. An asterisk (*) indicates the collection based on a 1977 publication and may not reflect the current collection.: 177–181 \nThe paintings inspired a scene in the 1973 horror film The Exorcist, which was used on the film's posters and home video releases, in which the character Father Merrin stands in front of the MacNeil family's house. It also inspired the artwork for the cover of Jackson Browne's 1974 album Late for the Sky.\nJohn Atkinson Grimshaw, Boar Lane, Leeds, 1880s\nCaspar David Friedrich, Abbey in the Oakwood (1809-10), oil on canvas, 171 x 110.4 cm., Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin\nCaspar David Friedrich, Church ruin in the forest (c. 1831), oil on canvas, 70.5 x 49.7 cm., Neue Pinakothek, Munich\nWilliam Degouve de Nuncques, The Blind House (1892), oil on canvas, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo\nWilliam Degouve de Nuncques, The Canal (1894), oil on canvas, 42,4 x 122,5 cm., Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo\n"

    "short_description": "Painting by Pablo Picasso",
    "painting_info": "La Gommeuse  is a 1901 oil-on-canvas painting by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. It dates from his  Blue Period and is noted for its caricature of Picasso's friend Pere Mañach painted on the reverse. Gommeuse was sexually charged slang of the time for café-concert singers and their songs. It was offered for sale ex the  William I. Koch collection at a Sotheby's, New York, auction on 5 November 2015. The painting realized $67.5 million at the sale, a record for a Blue Period Picasso, placing the painting among the most expensive ever sold.\nThe painting was executed in the second half of 1901 following Picasso's successful exhibition at the Vollard gallery that June. This was at the start of his  Blue Period of 1901 to 1904, thought to have been occasioned by the suicide of his friend Carlos Casagemas earlier in the year, a time when his paintings were somewhat melancholic and characterized by somber monochromatic tones in blue and green. During this time, Picasso, who was nearly 20, was sharing a studio flat in the Boulevard de Clichy with his friend Pere Mañach and was exploring the carnal pleasures of youth. Mañach was a Catalan anarchist who worked as a talent scout for art dealers and was responsible for organising Picasso's successful 1901 Vollard exhibition. A portrait of Mañach, which is now housed in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, was a feature of the Vollard show.\nLa Gommeuse is a nude portrait of a cabaret performer. The word \"gommeuse\" was a term used to describe cafe concert singers who were dressed in a suggestive manner. This subject matter reflects the pleasures of the Parisian nightlife, in which Picasso and his friend, Pere Mañach were immersed. The identity of the model is unknown, but she is unabashed by her nakedness and poses with a striking directness, as though with a sense of defiance.\nPicasso painted La Gommeuse in his studio on Boulevard de Clichy. A painting on the wall of the studio can be seen behind the woman, which appears to be a large, blue canvas depicting a figure wearing a dress and red stockings. It is similar to another painting that Picasso had created earlier in 1901, which was titled Nude with red stockings.\nThe model in this painting is displayed in the foreground to the left, her body outlined against the flat background to give emphasis to her figure. Her body is depicted using tones of green and ochre. The central theme of the image is of a woman who is both a siren and a figure of loneliness. Her figure is slumped, giving an impression of physical exhaustion and her face offers a sad, contemplative expression. Picasso historian Marilyn McCully commented that, \"The depictions of syphilitic prostitutes and poverty-stricken mothers in his Blue Period of late 1901-1902 was in many ways anticipated in La Gommeuse and works related to it\".\nA caricature of Picasso's friend Pere Mañach can be seen on the reverse and is inscribed \"Recuerdo a Mañach en el día de su santo\", demonstrating that the painting was intended as a gift for Mañach on his Saint's Day (29 June). The caricature is intentionally irreverent, depicting Mañach naked except for a red and yellow striped turban on his head. He is placed in a suggestive pose, urinating into the landscape.\nThe caricature remained undiscovered for over a century. It was revealed under the lining of the painting when conservation work took place in 2000. William Koch displayed in his home with a custom-made display so that both paintings could be viewed from opposite sides of the same wall.\nHelena Newman, chair of impressionist and modern art for Sotheby’s in Europe described the painting as, \"an absolutely incredible and major blue period work\" and opined that, \"The value sits in the front, but it  does give you a glimpse into what Picasso’s life must have been like in 1901 when he had just arrived in Paris and was still a relatively impoverished artist.\"\n\nPicasso historian Marilyn McCully summarised the significance of the painting, stating that it represents a pivotal moment in Picasso’s artistic development in 1901. The major influence was Toulouse Lautrec, both in subject matter – café scenes, prostitutes and dance halls – and, to some extent, technique, but Picasso's subsequent focus on isolated figures and restricted, subdued palettes in his new works emphasized his own exploration of the theme of loneliness and his interest in formal experimentation.In 2015 La Gommeuse was sold at Sotheby's auction in New York. The owner, American billionaire Bill Koch had acquired it for $3 million in 1984. The painting achieved a price of $67.5m, which was a record for a Blue Period work.\n"

    "painting_info": "Les Alyscamps (or 'L'Allée des Alyscamps') is a pair of paintings (\"pendants\") by Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted in 1888 in Arles, France, it depicts autumnal scenes in the Alyscamps, an ancient Roman necropolis in Arles which is lined with poplars and stone sarcophagi.\nVan Gogh also made another pair of paintings, Falling Autumn Leaves and Paul Gauguin made his own version of Les Alycamps.\nOne of the paintings was last auctioned in November 2003, selling for $11,767,500 at an auction in New York despite predictions that it might fetch between $12 and $18 million. Another of the paintings sold on May 5, 2015, for the sum of $66.3 million.\nFollowing months of correspondence, Paul Gauguin joined Van Gogh in Arles in October 1888.  Both were intent on depicting a \"non-naturalist landscape\". The paintings are of the first works that Van Gogh and Gauguin painted following Gauguin's arrival.\nVan Gogh and Gauguin visited an ancient Roman necropolis, \"Les Alyscamps\", which had been built by the Romans outside city walls.  Over time the grounds were overtaken by factories and the railroad, leaving the Allee des Tombeaux, (the avenue of tombs), a lane of shady poplar trees that led to a Romanesque chapel. This lane was known throughout France as a lovers' lane (the women of Arles celebrated for their beauty). The couples depicted in the painting are taking a romantic stroll in the evening and it was this aspect of the scene that especially attracted the artists' attention.\nThe two artists painted some identical subjects to compare their work with each other and chose the site of the Alyscamps to paint and compare.  They produced several works, including this painting, Van Gogh's Falling Autumn Leaves (Les Alyscamps) and Gauguin's Alyscamps.\nThe pair of paintings were made by Van Gogh and Gauguin soon after Gauguin arrived in Arles.  The painting portrays an ancient Roman cemetery, \"Les Alyscamps\" or \"Elysian Fields\" which were located south east of the Roman city walls.  Through careful analysis it appears that the two men worked together at Les Alyscamps between October 28 and 31, just before an onslaught of heavy rains that forced them indoors. Van Gogh painted four views, this Les Alyscamps pair and the pair of Falling Autumn Leaves paintings.  Gauguin produced two paintings.\nVan Gogh made another pair of paintings at Les Alyscamps called Falling Autumn Leaves.\nFalling Autumn Leaves1888Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo (F486)\nFalling Autumn Leaves1888Private collection (F487)\nFor his painting of Les Alyscamps, painted on the same day as Van Gogh's, Gauguin chose a different vantage point from Van Gogh, and excluded any reference to ancient sarcophagi.\nPaul Gauguin, Les Alyscamps1888Musée d'Orsay, Paris\nPaul Gauguin, Allée des Alyscamps1888Seiji Togo Memorial Sompo Japan Museum of Art, Tokyo\n"

    "painting_info": "\nFemme au béret et à la robe quadrillée (Marie-Thérèse Walter) (Woman wearing a beret and checkered dress) is an oil-on-canvas painting by Pablo Picasso, which he created in 1937. It is a portrait of Marie-Thérèse Walter, Picasso's lover and muse during this period and was created with elements of Cubism. The painting signifies a transition in their relationship by combining Walter's profile with that of Picasso's new lover, the Surrealist photographer Dora Maar, with whom he began a relationship in 1936. This portrait was produced in the same year as Guernica and The Weeping Woman, a significant phase in Picasso's artistic career. On 28 February 2018, it was sold at Sotheby's auction for £49.8 million, making it one of the most expensive paintings ever sold at an auction in Europe.\nThis portrait reflects the artist's evolving relationship with Marie-Thérèse Walter during this period of their relationship. Prior to producing this work, Picasso had depicted his relationship with Walter as a blissful partnership, illustrated by the many sensual portraits that he created of her in 1932, which has led to her being described as Picasso's \"Golden Muse\". However, this painting reveals a change in their relationship over the course of five years. By 1937, Walter was the mother of Picasso's daughter, Maya, and her status as his mistress was under threat with the introduction of Dora Maar as a new love in the artist's life.\nThe painting was produced in 1937, a particularly significant year in Picasso's artistic career, in which he also produced Guernica and The Weeping Woman. These significant works were the result of a turbulent year defined by political unrest in Spain and the bombing of the town of Guernica. Produced in the December 1937, this portrait has been viewed as a continuation of The Weeping Woman theme. Neil Cox remarked on the perceived connection between Picasso's turbulent personal life and the political upheaval of the period, stating, \"For Picasso the question of 'modernity' was acute in the 1930s and 1940s, since modernity in this period meant a personal life, a nation, a Europe and indeed a world in crisis. This period in Picasso's art is marked by a succession of shattering events in his personal life that no doubt appeared to him mirrored by the disasters in the world at large.\" Picasso's response to these turbulent events was to focus all of his attention on the monumental work of Guernica at the beginning of 1937. Both Walter and Maar played a significant role in the creation of Guernica, with Walter appearing at least twice in the composition. Maar played a more practical role in the development of the work, as she not only documented its progress, but also assisted with its painting.\nPicasso first met 17-year-old Walter on the street outside Galeries Lafayette in 1927. She was a respectable girl who lived with her mother and sisters in Maisons-Alfort, a suburb of Paris. At the time, Picasso was aged 47 and unhappily married to Olga Khoklova, a Russian ballerina. Picasso approached Walter and asked to paint her portrait. He said, \"You have an interesting face, I would like to do a portrait of you. I am Picasso\". Walter had no knowledge of who Picasso was, but was flattered by his attention. Within two weeks they had begun a secret affair that was reflected by a change in Picasso's artistic approach. During this period, he created many portraits of Walter, such as Le Repos, which were characterised by sinuous curves that convey her voluptuous form and his great passion for her as his mistress and muse. For Picasso, this new romance offered a kind of rebirth in his personal life, illustrated by symbolic bowls of fruit and flowers, which contrasted with the staid portraits of his wife that he rendered in a formal, neoclassical style. Walter described their relationship, stating, \"My life with him was always secret, calm and peaceful. We said nothing to anyone. We were happy like that, and we did not ask anything more.\" John Richardson, Picasso's friend and biographer opined that, \"Picasso was more in love than he had ever been\". By 1928, images produced of Picasso's wife were now characterised by tortured forms and jagged lines that display her increasing rage and aggression. In 1934 Khoklova left Picasso and moved out of their apartment following an exhibition that revealed the secret relationship in a series of nude portraits of Walter. On Christmas Eve of 1934, Walter told Picasso that she was pregnant and he promised to get a divorce from Khoklova, which was filed six months later. On 5 September 1935, Walter gave birth to a daughter, Maya, which led to Picasso creating several works depicting his new family. They remained together for over ten years but never married. In the autumn of 1937, Picasso and his family moved to Le Tremblay-sur-Mauldre, but this year also marked the beginning of a new love in his life, in the person of Dora Maar.\nTwo months after the birth of Maya in 1935, Picasso attended the opening of a movie, where he was introduced to Dora Maar, by the French poet Paul Éluard. Born Henriette Théodora Markovitch, she was a talented photographer, an intellectual, and involved in the Surrealist movement. Maar initially trained as a painter in the 1920s but became interested in photography. By 1931, she had opened a studio and renamed herself Dora Maar. Maar and Picasso began a relationship and, in August 1936, Picasso spent time apart from Walter by taking a trip to Mougins with Maar alongside Paul Éluard and his wife, Roland Penrose and his wife, and Man Ray and his mistress. In September 1936, Walter was offered Picasso's home at Le Tremblay-sur-Mauldre, located 28 miles from Paris. This provided Picasso with the freedom to maintain both relationships over a period of three years. Over the course of their relationship, Picasso's portrayals of his mistress changed. Initially he depicted her as a nymph or a bird, but by 1937, his paintings had begun to portray her in tears, most notably in The Weeping Woman. As well as being emotionally fractious, Maar's relationship with Picasso was influential in terms of his artwork and political outlook. Frances Morris, Director of Tate Modern commented, \"He trusted her. As much as being a sexual or emotional relationship, it was a collaborative one\".\nPicasso made efforts to ensure that Walter and Maar would not meet, but eventually they did. According to Picasso, the tension between his two mistresses reached a crisis point in 1937, while he was in the process of finishing Guernica. Picasso related a story to Françoise Gilot of a day when both women had arrived at his studio at the same time and had begun arguing. In her memoir titled Life with Picasso, Gilot recalled that Picasso had said, \"I kept on painting and they kept on arguing\". Walter had demanded that Picasso should choose between them. Picasso stated, \"I was satisfied with things as they were. I told them they'd have to fight it out for themselves. So they began to wrestle. It's one of my choicest memories\". Picasso continued to maintain both relationships with his mistresses after the outbreak of World War II. Picasso spent the war in occupied Paris. By 1945, his relationship with Maar had come to an end. Picasso had subjected her to physical and emotional abuse and she consequently suffered a nervous breakdown. After the war, Picasso relocated to the South of France with Françoise Gilot, his new partner, with whom he had two children.\nFemme au béret et à la robe quadrillée (Marie-Thérèse Walter) is an oil-on-canvas portrait of Picasso's mistress, which he created on 4 December 1937. It measures 55 x 46 cm and is dated 4 D 37 on the upper right. The painting depicts Walter using a palette of bright colours, bold, black outlines and geometric shapes. She is shown to be wearing a beret and a check dress. Walter's face is portrayed in profile, yet her features are depicted from the front, in a cubist style that is similar to other portraits that Picasso created.\nAlthough Walter's features can clearly be identified as the subject of the painting, there are other elements within the portrait that suggest the presence of Picasso's new lover, Dora Maar, with whom he became involved in 1936. In this portrait, Walter is portrayed as a grown woman, who has matured since meeting Picasso outside Galeries Lafayette in 1927. The portrait illustrates a change in Picasso's feelings towards Walter, in the form of an additional dark silhouette that represents the profile of Maar. The portrait appears to merge the profiles of both women, illustrating that Picasso's affections were moving from one to the other. James Mackie, Sotheby's head of Impressionist & Modern Art noted that, \"While substantially this is a portrait of Walter, it’s also a painting about duality.\" Picasso had previously employed the use of a shadowy silhouette in an earlier painting titled Buste de femme et autoportrait, which he created in 1929 at a time when his marriage to Olga Khokhlova was disintegrating. The painting illustrated the conflict between Picasso and his wife by merging her features with his own. This duality is also evident in a 1937 painting of Walter titled Marie-Thérèse with Red Beret with Pompom, in which the features of Walter and Maar are both present. Maya Ruiz-Picasso commented on this merging of the two women, stating, \"My father…never tired of drawing , painting her, sculpting her, engraving her. But in this painting, it's a combination of my mother and Dora Maar. It's my mother's hair and eyes, but the nose and tones recall Dora Maar, who entered his life in 1936, shortly after I was born\".\nThe combined presence of the two women in Femme au béret et à la robe quadrillée (Marie-Thérèse Walter) is further illustrated by the blurring of artistic styles within the painting. Until this point, Picasso had typically depicted Walter using soft, voluptuous curved lines, while Maar was usually portrayed using sharp, angular shapes. This merging of styles has been considered to be a means for the artist to explore his emotions towards both women. Sotheby's notes that the work displays Picasso's unresolved feelings towards both mistresses, stating, \"A vividly realised portrait, it combines his two central muses during this critical period, and achieves the remarkable in encompassing the complexities of real life and revealing simultaneously the artist's contrary emotions\".\nPalau i Fabre suggests that this painting is one of several portraits of Walter in which she is \"entirely reduced to inner tears\", and displays \"a resigned sadness, and nonetheless suffused with love\". He further opines that this is part of a continued theme in which Picasso \"had devoted almost all of his activity as a painter to woman, her troubles, her sadness, her loneliness. And, in the course of the past ten years, life had led him to depict two women crying. People speak of Dora Maar but too often forget that Marie-Thérèse has also been seen very often, and earlier, as a weeping woman\".\nThe painting was originally in the estate of the artist. It was then held in a private collection. On 28 February 2018, the painting was sold at Sotheby's auction for £49,827,000 to Harry Smith, the chairman of the art appraisal and advisory firm Gurr Johns. It was the most expensive painting ever sold at auction in Europe, and the second most expensive work of art, after Alberto Giacometti's  sculpture The Walking Man.\n"

    "painting_info": "Spring is a painting by Édouard Manet that was created in 1881. It debuted at the Paris Salon of 1882 and was considered the greatest and final public success of Manet's Salon career. It depicts Parisian actress Jeanne DeMarsy in a floral dress with parasol and bonnet against a background of lush foliage and blue sky, as the embodiment of Spring. The painting also became the first work of art ever to be published in color.\nSpring was the first of a planned quartet of allegorical works using chic Parisian women to depict the four seasons. The idea came from Manet's friend, Antonin Proust, who suggested a series of seasons personified by contemporary ideals of women, fashion and beauty. The series was never finished and Manet died a year after finishing only the second of the series, Autumn.\nIn November 2014, the J. Paul Getty Museum paid more than $65 million for the painting, surpassing the previous record of $33.2 million for a Manet which was paid for Self Portrait With a Palette in 2010.\n"

    "painting_info": "1949-A-No. 1 (PH 89) ist ein Bild des US-amerikanischen Malers Clyfford Still. Das Bild, das zu den Meisterwerken des Abstrakten Expressionismus zählt, wurde am 9. November 2011 für 61.682.500 Dollar bei Sotheby’s versteigert.\nLink zum Bild(Bitte Urheberrechte beachten)\nClyfford Still gab seinen Bildern keine Namen, in Ausstellungen laufen sie in der Regel unter Untitled. Ab 1938 begann er die Bilder zu nummerieren: er bezeichnete sie mit dem Jahr, in dem sie entstanden sind, frühe Bilder erhielten zusätzlich einen Buchstaben. Der Zusatz PH NN bezeichnet eine laufende Nummer in einer Liste, die Patricia Still angelegt hat, und in der die Fotografien seiner Werke eingetragen sind. Diese Nummerierung dient heute der Wissenschaft als Grundlage einer genauen Identifizierung der einzelnen Bilder.\nIn seinem Testament vom 2. Mai 1978 vermachte Still seinen gesamten künstlerischen Nachlass, bestehend aus 825 Bildern auf Leinwand, 1.575 Arbeiten auf Papier und 3 Skulpturen\nderjenigen US-amerikanischen Stadt, die ein Museum ausschließlich für seine Werke bauen würde. Als Testamentsvollstrecker waren seine Frau Patricia Still und seine beiden Töchter eingesetzt. Verhandlungen mit amerikanischen Museen nach Stills Tod gestalteten sich zäh und wurden von Patricia Still nur zögernd vorangetrieben. Nach ihrem Tod wurden die meist großformatigen Bilder zusammengerollt in einem alten Lagerhaus in Denver aufbewahrt. Schließlich stellte Stills Neffe Curt Freed Kontakt zum Oberbürgermeister der Stadt Denver, John Hickenlooper, her. County und Stadt Denver nahmen die Schenkung an und ließen ein Museum bauen, das am 8. November 2011 eröffnet wurde.\nBei der Auktion am 9. November 2011, die vom Stadtrat der Stadt Denver einstimmig beschlossen wurde, obwohl nach dem Wortlaut des Testaments keine Bilder aus der Schenkung verkauft werden durften\nwurden vier Bilder zur Deckung der Kosten versteigert. Die Auktion bei Sotheby's brachte der Stadt eine Summe von 114,1 Millionen Dollar ein.\nVersteigert wurden an diesem Tag außer PH 89 (1949-A.No.1) (1949) die Bilder PH-351 (1940), PH-584 (1947) und PH-1033 (1976).\nAm Tag der Sotheby’s Contemporary Art Auction, als Sotheby's einen Gesamtumsatz von 315,8 Millionen Dollar machte, kam es vor dem Auktionsgebäude zu lautstarken Protesten von Bankenkritikern, die seit Wochen im Bankenviertel von Manhattan demonstrierten sowie von gewerkschaftlich organisierten Angehörigen von Auktionshäusern, die sich in den vorangegangenen Lohnverhandlungen übergangen fühlten.\nDie Farben Maronenbraun und Schwarz dominieren das hochformatige und großdimensionierte Bild, dazu kommen im linken unteren Bilddrittel ein helles Grau, Cremeweiß, wenige weiße Farbtupfen verstreut über die Leinwand und ein die Bildwirkung bestimmender langer, unregelmäßiger und schmaler weißer Farbstreifen, der senkrecht verläuft und das Bild im rechten Drittel wie ein Spalt oder eine Kluft aufzubrechen scheint.\nDie reinen Farben sind, wie bei vielen seiner Bilder, mit dem Malmesser pastos aufgetragen, was der Bildoberfläche eine rauen, fast dreidimensionalen Effekt verleiht.\nDas Bild ist auf der Vorderseite signiert mit Clyfford 4, und trägt auf der Rückseite den Titel 1949-A.\nWerke des Abstrakten Expressionismus erzielen heute auf Auktionen Spitzenpreise, da es sich hier um ein abgegrenztes, überschaubares Marktsegment handelt, Werke eher selten angeboten werden und die Preise seit Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts steil angestiegen sind.\nBilder von Clyfford Still, der zu seinen Lebzeiten nur wenige Bilder verkaufte, erscheinen relativ selten auf dem Kunstmarkt, zumal sich rund 94 % seines Œeuvre in seinem Haus, bzw. nach seinem Tod in einem Lager befanden und heute Bestand des Clyfford-Still Museums in Denver sind.\nEs gibt nur wenige Privatsammler und Museen in den USA und in Europa, die überhaupt Bilder von Clyfford Still besitzen, darunter vor allem das San Francisco Museum of Art, das 1975 eine Stiftung von 21 Bildern erhielt, das New Yorker Museum of Modern Art, das in einem eigenen Raum 10 Bilder zeigt, die es seit 1986 als Schenkung besitzt und die Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, die mit 33 Werken, die zwischen 1937 und 1963 entstanden sind, die bisher umfangreichste Clyfford-Still-Sammlung in USA beherbergte.\n\n"

    "short_description": "Series of paintings by Claude Monet",
    "painting_info": "\nWater Lilies (or Nymphéas, French: ) is a series of approximately 250 oil paintings by French Impressionist Claude Monet (1840–1926). The paintings depict his flower garden at his home in Giverny, and were the main focus of his artistic production during the last thirty years of his life. Many of the works were painted while Monet suffered from cataracts.\nMonet's long-standing preference for producing and exhibiting a series of paintings related by subject and perspective began in 1889, with at least ten paintings done at the Valley of the Creuse, which were shown at the Galerie Georges Petit.  Among his other famous series are his Haystacks.\nDuring the 1920s, the state of France built a pair of oval rooms at the Musée de l'Orangerie as a permanent home for eight water lily murals by Monet. The exhibit opened to the public on 16 May 1927, a few months after Monet's death. Sixty water lily paintings from around the globe were assembled for a special exhibition at the Musée de l'Orangerie in 1999.\nThe paintings are on prominent display at museums all over the world, including the Princeton University Art Museum, Musée Marmottan Monet, the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Saint Louis Art Museum, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri, the Carnegie Museum of Art, the National Museum of Wales, the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes, The Toledo Museum of Art the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Portland Art Museum and the Legion of Honor.  In 2020, The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston celebrated its 150-anniversary with some of Monet's Water Lilies paintings.\nOn 19 June 2007, one of Monet's Water Lily paintings sold for £18.5 million at a Sotheby's auction in London. On 24 June 2008 another of his Water Lily paintings, Le Bassin Aux Nymphéas, sold for almost £41 million at Christie's in London, almost double the estimate of £18 to £24 million.\nIn May 2010, it was announced that the 1906 Nymphéas work would be auctioned in London in June 2010. The painting had an estimated sale price of between £30 and £40 million. Giovanna Bertazzoni, Christie's auction house director and head of impressionist and modern art, said, \"Claude Monet's water-lily paintings are amongst the most recognised and celebrated works of the 20th Century and were hugely influential to many of the following generations of artists.\" The sale took place on 23 June 2010 at the auction house and the painting attracted bids of up to £29 million, but it ultimately failed to sell.\nOn 6 May 2014, one of the Water Lilies, Le Bassin aux Nymphéas, was auctioned at Christie's, New York City for $27 million.\nIn June 2014, one of the Water Lilies, Nymphéas, sold for $54 million USD at a Sotheby's auction in London. This piece was auctioned to an anonymous buyer, but the piece went on to be part of the exhibition \"Painting the Modern Garden: From Monet to Matisse\" at the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Royal Academy of Arts, London, starting in 2015. The co-chairman of Sotheby's modern and impressionist art department, Helena Newman, claims that the result is at the top of the original estimated selling price. This price was between 34 and 51 million USD.\nWhile many of Monet’s masterpieces have sold, there are still an estimated 250 oil paintings from this series. The collection is widely popular, with many of these pieces residing in exhibits that have yet to go to auction. The paintings have been catalogued by Daniel Wildenstein in his Monet: Catalogue Raisonné.\nLe Bassin Aux Nymphéas, 1919, private collection\nWater Lilies, 1919, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City\nNymphéas, 1915, Musée Marmottan Monet\nNymphéas (Waterlilies), 1914–17, National Gallery of Australia\nCloseup of Water lily pond, one of 18 views of the pond, 1899, Boston Museum of Fine Arts\n"
